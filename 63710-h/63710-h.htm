<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a source of much, gratification to the Author to find
himself called upon to prepare a Third Edition of his
Manual in less than fourteen months from the date of its
first publication. No greater proof could have been afforded
of the rapid advance which the Photographic Art
is now making in this country.</p>

<p>On once more entering upon the task of revision, the
Writer has been led to reflect in what way the utility of
the Work may be promoted; and from numerous inquiries
he believes that this result will best be attained by carefully
omitting everything which does not possess <i>practical</i>
as well as scientific interest. The majority of Photographers
look to the Art to furnish them with amusement as
well as instruction, and they are deterred from entering
upon a study which seems to involve a great amount of
technical detail: these remarks however are not intended
to discourage a habit of perseverance and careful observation,
but simply to distinguish between the essential and
the non-essential in the theory of the subject.</p>

<p>The present Edition differs in many important particulars
from those which have preceded it. It has undergone
a fresh arrangement throughout. In some parts it is condensed,
in others enlarged. The Chapters on Photographic
Printing are entirely re-written, and include the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of the Author's investigations, as published in the Society's
Journal. The minute directions given in this part of the
Work will show how much success in Photography is
thought to depend upon a careful attention to minor particulars.</p>

<p>Another point which has been kept in view, is to recommend,
as far as possible, the employment of chemical
agents which are used in medicine and vended by all
druggists throughout the united kingdom. It is often an
advantage to the Amateur to be able to purchase his materials
near at hand; and, if the common impurities of the
commercial articles are pointed out, and directions given
for their removal, the 'London Pharmacop&#339;ia' will be
found to include almost all the chemicals necessary for the
practice of the Art.</p>

<p>Great additions have been made to the Index of the present
Edition, which is now so complete that a reference
to it will at once point out the most important facts relating
to each subject, and the different parts of the Work
at which they are described.</p>

<p>In conclusion, a hope is expressed that this 'Manual of
Photographic Chemistry' may be found to be a complete
and trustworthy guide on every point connected with the
theory and practice of the Collodion process.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Author has endeavoured to keep pace with the improvements
which are daily being introduced in the science
and art of Photography. In the present Edition
alterations have been made in the style and general arrangement
of the work, and additional matter has been
inserted.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the Third Edition, a series of
experiments have been made on the manufacture of Collodion,
the results of which have thrown further light upon
the conditions affecting the sensitiveness of the excited
film, and have enabled the writer to introduce an organic
substance, "Glycyrrhizine," which will be found of service
in making Photographic copies of Engravings and similar
works of Art.</p>

<p>Dr. Norris, of Birmingham, has within the last few
months communicated a paper on <i>dry Collodion</i>, which
places the theory of that subject upon a better footing
than before. The Oxymel preservative process is now also
thoroughly understood, and may be considered certain.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the "Albuminized Collodion"
of M. Taupenot, which experience proves to be one of the
best dry processes at present known, is included in this
Edition.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">In</span> attempting to impart knowledge on any subject, it is
not sufficient that the writer should himself be acquainted
with that which he professes to teach. Even supposing
such to be the case, yet much of the success of his effort
must depend upon the manner in which the information is
conveyed; for as, on the one hand, a system of extreme
brevity always fails of its object, so, on the other, a mere
compilation of facts imperfectly explained tends only to
confuse the reader.</p>

<p>A middle course between these extremes is perhaps the
best to adopt; that is, to make selection of certain fundamental
points, and to explain them with some minuteness,
leaving others of less importance to be dealt with in a more
summary manner, or to be altogether omitted.</p>

<p>But independently of observations of this kind, which
apply to educational instruction in general, it may be remarked,
that there are sometimes difficulties of a more
formidable description to be overcome. For instance, in
treating of any science, such as that of Photography,
which may be said to be comparatively new and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
unexplored, there is great danger of erroneously attributing
effects to their wrong causes! Perhaps none but he who
has himself worked in the laboratory can estimate this
point in its proper light. In an experiment where the
quantities of material acted upon are infinitesimally small,
and the chemical changes involved of a most refined and
subtle description, it is soon discovered that the slightest
variation in the usual conditions will suffice to alter the
result.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Photography is truly <i>a science</i>, governed
by fixed laws; and hence, as our knowledge increases, we
may fairly hope that uncertainty will cease, and the same
precision at length be attained as that with which chemical
operations are usually performed.</p>

<p>The intention of the author in writing this work, is to
impart a thorough knowledge of what may be termed the
"First Principles of Photography," that the amateur may
arm himself with a theoretical acquaintance with the subject
before proceeding to the practice of it. To assist this
object, care will be taken to avoid needless complexity in
the formulæ, and all ingredients will be omitted which are
not proved to be of service.</p>

<p>The impurities of chemicals will be pointed out as far as
possible, and special directions given for their removal.</p>

<p>Amongst the variety of Photographic processes devised,
those only will be selected which are correct on theoretical
grounds, and are found in practice to succeed.</p>

<p>As the work is addressed to one supposed to be unacquainted
both with Chemistry and Photography, pains will
be taken to avoid the employment of all technical terms
of which an explanation has not previously been given.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">A SKETCH OF THE MAIN DIVISIONS TO BE ADOPTED, WITH
THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT-MATTER OF EACH.</p>

<p>The title given to the Work is "A Manual of Photographic
Chemistry," and it is proposed to include in it a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
familiar explanation of the nature of the various chemical
agents employed in the Art of Photography, with the
rationale of the manner in which they are thought to act.</p>

<p>The division adopted is threefold:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Part I.</span> enters minutely into the <i>theory</i> of Photographic
processes; <span class="smcap">Part II.</span> treats of the <i>practice</i> of Photography
upon Collodion; <span class="smcap">Part III.</span> embraces a simple statement
of the main laws of Chemistry, with the principal properties
of the various substances, elementary or compound,
which are employed by Photographers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Part I.</span>, or "the Science of Photography," includes a
full description of the chemical action of Light upon the
Salts of Silver, with its application to artistic purposes; all
mention of manipulatory details, and of quantities of ingredients,
being, as a rule, omitted.</p>

<p>In this division of the Work will be found nine Chapters,
the contents of which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Chapter I. is a sketch of the history of Photography,
intended to convey a general notion of the origin and
progress of the Art, without dwelling on minute particulars.</p>

<p>Chapter II. describes the Chemistry of the Salts of
Silver employed by Photographers; their preparation and
properties; the phenomena of the action of Light upon
them, with experiments illustrating it.</p>

<p>Chapter III. leads us on to the formation of <i>an invisible
image</i> upon a sensitive surface, with the development or
bringing out to view of the same by means of chemical
re-agents. This point, being of elementary importance,
is described carefully;&mdash;the reduction of metallic oxides,
the properties of the bodies employed to reduce, and the
hypotheses which have been entertained on the nature of
the Light's action, are all minutely explained.</p>

<p>Chapter IV. treats of the fixing of Photographic impressions,
in order to render them indestructible by diffused
light.</p>

<p>Chapter V. contains a sketch of the <i>Optics</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Photography&mdash;the decomposition of white Light into its elementary
rays, the Photographic properties of the different colours,
the refraction of Light, and construction of Lenses.
In the last Section of the same Chapter will be found a
short sketch of the history and use of the Stereoscope.</p>

<p>Chapter VI. embraces a more minute description of the
sensitive Photographic processes upon Collodion. In it is
explained the chemistry of Pyroxyline, with its solution
in Alcoholized Ether, or <i>Collodion</i>; also the Photographic
properties of Iodide of Silver upon Collodion, with the
causes which affect its sensitiveness to Light, and the action
of the developing solutions in bringing out the image.</p>

<p>Chapter VII. continues the same subject, describing the
classification of Collodion Photographs as Positives and
Negatives, with the distinctive peculiarities of each.</p>

<p>Chapter VIII. contains the theory of the production of
Positive Photographs upon paper. In this Chapter will be
found an explanation of the somewhat complex chemical
changes involved in printing Positives, with the precautions
which are required to ensure the permanency of the
proofs.</p>

<p>Chapter IX. is supplementary to the others, and a brief
notice of it will suffice. It explains the theory of the Photographic
processes of Daguerre and Talbot; especially
noticing those points in which they may be contrasted with
Photography upon Collodion, but omitting all description
of manipulatory details, which if included would extend
the Work beyond its proposed limits.</p>

<p>The title of the second principal division of the Work,
viz. "The practice of Photography upon Collodion," explains
itself. Attention however may be invited to the
fifth Chapter, in which a classification is given of the principal
imperfections in Photographs, with short directions
for their removal; and to Chapter VI., which describes the
preservation of the sensitiveness of Collodion plates and
the mode of operating upon films of Albumenized Collodion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>In Part III. will be found, in addition to a statement
of the laws of chemical combination, etc., a list of Photographic
chemicals, alphabetically arranged, including their
preparation and properties as far as required for their employment
in the Art.</p>

<p>The reader will at once gather from this sketch of the
contents of the volume before him, that whilst the general
theory of every Photographic process is described, with
the preparation and properties of the chemicals employed,
minute directions in the minor points of manipulation are
restricted to Photography upon Collodion, that branch
of the Art being the one to which the time and attention
of the author have been especially directed. Collodion is
allowed by all to be the best vehicle for the sensitive Silver
Salts which is at present known, and successful results can
be obtained with a very small expenditure of time and
trouble, if the solutions employed in the process are prepared
in a state of purity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">HISTORICAL SKETCH OF PHOTOGRAPHY.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Art of Photography, which has now attained such
perfection, and has become so popular amongst all classes,
is one of comparatively recent introduction.</p>

<p>The word Photography means literally "writing by
means of Light;" and it includes all processes by which
any kind of picture can be obtained by the chemical agency
of Light, without reference to the nature of the sensitive
surface upon which it acts.</p>

<p>The philosophers of antiquity, although chemical changes
due to the influence of Light were continually passing before
their eyes, do not appear to have directed their attention
to them. Some of the <i>Alchemists</i> indeed noticed the
fact that a substance which they termed "Horn Silver,"
which was probably a Chloride of Silver which had undergone
fusion, became <i>blackened</i> by exposure to Light; but
their ideas on such subjects being of the most erroneous
nature, nothing resulted from the discovery.</p>

<p>The first philosophical examination of the decomposing
action of Light upon compounds containing Silver was
made by the illustrious Scheele, no longer than three-quarters
of a century ago, viz. in 1777. It was also remarked
by him that some of the coloured rays of Light were peculiarly
active in promoting the change.</p>

<p><i>Earliest application of these facts to purposes of Art.</i>&mdash;The
first attempts to render the blackening of Silver Salts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
by Light available for artistic purposes were made by
Wedgwood and Davy about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1802. A sheet of white
paper or of white leather was saturated with a solution of
Nitrate of Silver, and the <i>shadow</i> of the figure intended to
be copied projected upon it. Under these circumstances
the part on which the shadow fell remained white, whilst
the surrounding exposed parts gradually darkened under
the influence of the sun's rays.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these and similar experiments, which appeared
at the outset to promise well, were checked by the
experimentalists being unable to discover any means of
fixing the pictures, so as to render them indestructible by
diffused Light. The unchanged Silver Salt being permitted
to remain in the white portions of the paper, naturally
caused the proofs to blacken in every part, unless
carefully preserved in the dark.</p>

<p><i>Introduction of the Camera Obscura, and other Improvements
in Photography.</i>&mdash;The "Camera Obscura," or darkened
chamber, by means of which a luminous image of an
object may be formed, was invented by Baptista Porta, of
Padua; but the preparations employed by Wedgwood were
not sufficiently sensitive to be easily affected by the subdued
light of that instrument.</p>

<p>In the year 1814, however, twelve years subsequent to
the publication of Wedgwood's paper, M. Niépce, of Chalons,
having directed his attention to the subject, succeeded
in perfecting a process in which the Camera could be employed,
although the sensibility was still so low that an exposure
of some hours was required to produce the effect.</p>

<p>In the process of M. Niépce, which was termed "Heliography,"
or "sun-drawing," the use of the Silver Salts
was discarded, and a resinous substance, known as "Bitumen
of Judæa," substituted. This resin was smeared on
the surface of a metal plate, and exposed to the luminous
image. The light in acting upon it so changed its properties,
that it became <i>insoluble</i> in certain essential oils.
Hence, on subsequent treatment with the oleaginous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
solvent, the shadows dissolved away, and the <i>lights</i> were represented
by the unaltered resin remaining on the plate.</p>

<p><i>The Discoveries of M. Daguerre.</i>&mdash;MM. Niépce and
Daguerre appear at one time to have been associated as
partners, for the purpose of mutually prosecuting their researches;
but it was not until after the death of the former,
viz. in 1839, that the process named the Daguerreotype
was given to the world. Daguerre was dissatisfied
with the slowness of action of the Bitumen sensitive surface,
and directed his attention mainly to the use of the
Salts of Silver, which are thus again brought before our
notice.</p>

<p>Even the earlier specimens of the Daguerreotype, although
far inferior to those subsequently produced, possessed
a beauty which had not been attained by any Photographs
prior to that time.</p>

<p>The sensitive plates of Daguerre were prepared by exposing
a silvered tablet to the action of the vapour of
<i>Iodine</i>, so as to form a layer of Iodide of Silver upon the
surface. By a short exposure in the Camera an effect was
produced, not visible to the eye, but appearing when the
plate was subjected to the vapour of Mercury. This feature,
viz. the production of a <i>latent</i> image upon Iodide of
Silver, with its subsequent development by a chemical reagent,
is one of the first importance. Its discovery at once
reduced the time of taking a picture from hours to minutes,
and promoted the utility of the Art.</p>

<p>Daguerre also succeeded in fixing his proofs, by removal
of the unaltered Iodide of Silver from the shadows. The
processes employed however were imperfect, and the matter
was not set at rest until the publication of a paper by
Sir John Herschel, on the property possessed by "Hyposulphites"
of dissolving the Salts of Silver insoluble in
water.</p>

<p><i>On a means of Multiplying Photographic Impressions,
and other Discoveries of Mr. Fox Talbot.</i>&mdash;The first communication
made to the Royal Society by Mr. Fox Talbot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in January, 1839, included only the preparation of a sensitive
paper for copying objects by application. It was directed
that the paper should be dipped first in solution of
Chloride of Sodium, and then in Nitrate of Silver. In this
way a white substance termed Chloride of Silver is formed,
more sensitive to light than the Nitrate of Silver originally
employed by Wedgwood and Davy. The object is laid in
contact with the prepared paper, and, being exposed to
light, a copy is obtained, which is Negative,&mdash;<i>id est</i>, with
the light and shade reversed. A second sheet of paper is
then prepared, and the first, or Negative impression, laid
upon it, so as to allow the sun's light to pass through the
transparent parts. Under these circumstances, when the
Negative is raised, a natural representation of the object is
found below; the tints having been again reversed by the
second operation.</p>

<p>This production of a Negative Photograph, from which
any number of Positive copies may be obtained, is a cardinal
point in Mr. Talbot's invention, and one of great importance.</p>

<p>The patent issued for the process named Talbotype or
Calotype dates from February, 1841. A sheet of paper
is first coated with Iodide of Silver by soaking it alternately
in Iodide of Potassium and Nitrate of Silver; it
is then washed with solution of Gallic Acid containing
Nitrate of Silver (sometimes termed Gallo-Nitrate of Silver),
by which the sensibility to light is greatly augmented.
An exposure in the Camera of some seconds or minutes,
according to the brightness of the light, impresses an invisible
image, which is brought out by treating the plate
with a fresh portion of the mixture of Gallic Acid and
Nitrate of Silver employed in exciting.</p>

<p>On the use of Glass Plates to retain Sensitive Films.&mdash;The
principal defects in the Calotype process are attributable
to the coarse and irregular structure of the fibre of
paper, even when manufactured with the greatest care, and
expressly for Photographic purposes. In consequence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
this, the same amount of exquisite definition and sharpness
of outline as that resulting from the use of metal plates,
cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Sir John Herschel for the first employment
of glass plates to receive sensitive Photographic
films.</p>

<p>The Iodide of Silver may be retained upon the glass by
means of a layer of Albumen or white of egg, as proposed
by M. Niépce de Saint-Victor, nephew to the original discoverer
of the same name.</p>

<p>A more important improvement still is the employment
of "Collodion" for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>Collodion is an ethereal solution of a substance almost
identical with Gun-Cotton. On evaporation it leaves a transparent
layer, resembling gold-beater's skin, which adheres
to the glass with some tenacity. M. Le Grey of Paris
originally suggested that this substance might possibly
be rendered available in Photography, but our own countryman,
Mr. Archer, was the first to carry out the idea
practically. In a communication to 'The Chemist' in the
autumn of 1851, this gentleman gave a description of the
Collodion process much as it now stands; at the same
time proposing the substitution of <i>Pyro</i>-gallic acid for the
Gallic acid previously employed in developing the image.</p>

<p>At that period no idea could have been entertained of
the stimulus which this discovery would render to the progress
of the Art; but experience has now abundantly demonstrated,
that, as far as all qualities most desirable in a
Photographic process are concerned, none at present known
can excel, or perhaps equal, the Collodion process.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE SALTS OF SILVER EMPLOYED IN PHOTOGRAPHY.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">By</span> the term Salt of Silver we understand that the compound
in question contains Silver, but not in its elementary
form; the metal is in fact in a state of chemical union
with other elements which disguise its physical properties,
so that the Salt possesses none of the external characters
of the Silver from which it was produced.</p>

<p>Silver is not the only metal which forms Salts; there
are Salts of Lead, Copper, Iron, etc. Sugar of Lead is a
familiar instance of a Salt of Lead. It is a white crystalline
body, easily soluble in water, the solution possessing
an intensely sweet taste; chemical tests prove that it contains
Lead, although no suspicion of such a fact could be
entertained from a consideration of its general properties.</p>

<p>Common Salt, or Chloride of Sodium, which is the type
of the salts generally, is constituted in a similar manner;
that is to say, it contains a metallic substance, the characters
of which are masked, and lie hid in the compound.</p>

<p>The contents of this Chapter may be arranged in three
Sections: the first describing the Chemistry of the Salts
of Silver; the second, the action of Light upon them;
the third, the preparation of a sensitive surface, with experiments
illustrating the formation of the Photographic
image.</p>

<p class="caption3">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="tdc">Chemistry of the Salts of Silver.</p>

<p>The principal Salts of Silver employed in the Photographic
processes are four in number, viz. Nitrate of
Silver, Chloride of Silver, Iodide of Silver, and Bromide
of Silver. In addition to these, it will be necessary to describe
the Oxides of Silver.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF THE NITRATE
OF SILVER.</p>

<p>Nitrate of Silver is prepared by dissolving metallic Silver
in Nitric Acid. Nitric Acid is a powerfully acid and corrosive
substance, containing two elementary bodies united
in definite proportions. These are Nitrogen and Oxygen;
the latter being present in greatest quantity.</p>

<p>Nitric Acid is a powerful solvent for the metallic bodies
generally. To illustrate its action in that particular, as
contrasted with other acids, place pieces of silver-foil in
two test-tubes, the one containing dilute Sulphuric, the
other dilute Nitric Acid; on the application of heat a violent
action soon commences in the latter, but the former
is unaffected. In order to understand this, it must be
borne in mind that when a metallic substance dissolves in
an acid, the nature of the solution is different from that
of an aqueous solution of salt or sugar. If salt water be
boiled down until the whole of the water has evaporated,
the salt is recovered with properties the same as at first;
but if a similar experiment be made with a solution of
Silver in Nitric Acid, the result is different: in that case
metallic Silver is not obtained on evaporation, but Silver
combined with Oxygen and Nitric Acid, both of which are
strongly retained, being in fact in a state of chemical combination
with the metal.</p>

<p>If we closely examine the effects produced by treating
Silver with Nitric Acid, we find them to be of the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
nature:&mdash;first, a certain amount of Oxygen is imparted to
the metal, so as to form an <i>Oxide</i>, which Oxide dissolves
in another portion of the Nitric Acid, producing <i>Nitrate</i>
of the Oxide, or, as it is shortly termed, Nitrate of Silver.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The preparation of Nitrate of Silver from the standard coin of
the realm is described in Part III., Art. "Silver."</p></div>

<p>It is the instability of Nitric Acid therefore&mdash;its proneness
to part with Oxygen&mdash;which renders it superior to the
Sulphuric and to most acids in dissolving Silver and various
other substances, both organic and inorganic.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;In preparing Nitrate
of Silver, when the metal has dissolved, the solution is
boiled down and set aside to crystallize. The salt however
as so obtained is still acid to test-paper, and requires either
re-crystallization, or careful heating to about 300° Fahrenheit.
It is this retention of small quantities of Nitric Acid,
and sometimes probably of Nitrous Acid, which renders
much of the commercial Nitrate of Silver useless for Photography,
until rendered neutral by fusion and a second
crystallization.</p>

<p>Pure Nitrate of Silver occurs in the form of white crystalline
plates, which are very heavy and dissolve readily
in an equal weight of cold water. The solubility is much
lessened by the presence of free Nitric Acid, and in the
<i>concentrated</i> Nitric Acid the crystals are almost insoluble.
Boiling Alcohol takes up about one-fourth part of its
weight of the crystallized Nitrate, but deposits nearly the
whole on cooling. Nitrate of Silver has an intensely bitter
and nauseous taste; acting as a caustic, and corroding the
skin by a prolonged application. Its aqueous solution does
not redden blue litmus-paper.</p>

<p>Heated in a crucible the salt melts, and when poured
into a mould and solidified, forms the white <i>lunar caustic</i>
of commerce. At a still higher temperature it is decomposed,
and bubbles of Oxygen Gas are evolved: the melted
mass cooled and dissolved in water leaving behind a black
powder, and yielding a solution, which is faintly alkaline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to test-paper, from the presence of minute quantities of
Nitrite or basic Nitrite of Silver.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Nitrite of Silver differs from the Nitrate in containing less
Oxygen, and is formed from it by the abstraction of two atoms of that
element; it is described in the vocabulary, Part III.</p></div>


<p class="caption4nb">THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CHLORIDES OF SILVER.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of Protochloride of Silver.</i>&mdash;The ordinary
white Chloride of Silver may be prepared in two ways,&mdash;by
the direct action of Chlorine upon metallic Silver, and
by double decomposition between two salts.</p>

<p>If a plate of polished silver be exposed to a current of
Chlorine Gas,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> it becomes after a short time coated on
the surface with a superficial film of white powder. This
powder is Chloride of Silver, containing the two elements
Chlorine and Silver united in single equivalents.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> For the properties of the element "Chlorine," see the third
division of the Work.</p></div>

<p><i>Preparation of Chloride of Silver by double decomposition.</i>&mdash;In
order to illustrate this, take a solution in water
of Chloride of Sodium or "common salt," and mix it with
a solution containing Nitrate of Silver; immediately a
dense, curdy, white precipitate falls, which is the substance
in question.</p>

<p>In this reaction the elements change places; the Chlorine
leaves the Sodium with which it was previously combined,
and crosses over to the Silver; the Oxygen and
Nitric Acid are released from the Silver, and unite with
the Sodium; thus</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdl">Chloride of Sodium</td>
  <td class="tdc"><i>plus</i></td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of Silver</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>equals</i></td>
  <td class="tdl">Chloride of Silver</td>
  <td class="tdc"><i>plus</i></td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of Soda.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This interchange of elements is termed by chemists
double decomposition; further illustrations of it, with the
conditions necessary to the proper establishment of the
process, are given in the first Chapter of Part III.</p>

<p>The essential requirements in two salts intended for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
preparation of Chloride of Silver, are simply that the first
should contain Chlorine, the second Silver, and that both
should be soluble in water; hence the Chloride of Potassium
or Ammonium may be substituted for the Chloride
of Sodium, and the Sulphate or Acetate for the Nitrate of
Silver.</p>

<p>In preparing Chloride of Silver by double decomposition,
the white clotty masses which first form must be washed
repeatedly with water, in order to free them from soluble
Nitrate of Soda, the other product of the change. When
this is done, the salt is in a pure state, and may be dried,
etc., in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Chloride of Silver.</i>&mdash;Chloride of Silver
differs in appearance from the Nitrate of Silver. It is not
usually crystalline, but forms a soft white powder resembling
common chalk or whiting. It is tasteless and insoluble
in water; unaffected by boiling with the strongest
Nitric Acid, but sparingly dissolved by concentrated Hydrochloric
Acid.</p>

<p>Ammonia dissolves Chloride of Silver freely, as do solutions
of Hyposulphite of Soda and Cyanide of Potassium.
Concentrated solutions of alkaline Chlorides, Iodides, and
Bromides are likewise solvents of Chloride of Silver, but
to a limited extent, as will be more fully shown in Chapter
IV., when treating of the modes of fixing the Photographic
proofs.</p>

<p>Dry Chloride of Silver carefully heated to redness fuses,
and concretes on cooling into a tough and semi-transparent
substance, which has been termed <i>horn silver</i> or <i>luna
cornea</i>.</p>

<p>Placed in contact with metallic Zinc or Iron acidified
with dilute Sulphuric Acid, Chloride of Silver is reduced
to the metallic state, the Chlorine passing to the other
metal under the decomposing influence of the galvanic
current which is established.</p>

<p><i>Preparation and Properties of the Subchloride of Silver.</i>&mdash;If
a plate of polished Silver be dipped in solution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Perchloride of Iron, or of Bichloride of Mercury, a <i>black stain</i>
is produced, the Iron or Mercury Salt losing a portion of
Chlorine, which passes to the Silver and converts it superficially
into Subchloride of Silver. This compound differs
from the white Chloride of Silver in containing less Chlorine;
the composition of the latter being represented by
the formula AgCl, that of the former may perhaps be
written as Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl(?).</p>

<p>Subchloride of Silver is interesting to the Photographer
as corresponding in properties and composition with the
ordinary Chloride of Silver blackened by light. It is a
pulverulent substance of a bluish-black colour not easily
affected by Nitric Acid but decomposed by fixing agents
such as Ammonia, Hyposulphite of Soda, or Cyanide of
Potassium, into Chloride of Silver which dissolves, and insoluble
metallic Silver.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE CHEMISTRY OF IODIDE OF SILVER.</p>

<p>The properties of <i>Iodine</i> are described in the third division
of the Work: they are analogous to those of Chlorine
and Bromine, the Silver Salts formed by these elements
bearing also a strong resemblance to each other.</p>

<p><i>Preparation and Properties of Iodide of Silver.</i>&mdash;Iodide
of Silver may be formed in an analogous manner to the
Chloride, viz. by the direct action of the vapour of Iodine
upon metallic Silver, or by double decomposition, between
solutions of Iodide of Potassium and Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p>When prepared by the latter mode it forms an impalpable
powder, the colour of which varies slightly with the
manner of precipitation. If the Iodide of Potassium be in
excess, the Iodide of Silver falls to the bottom of the vessel
nearly white; but with an excess of Nitrate of Silver it is
of a straw-yellow tint. This point may be noticed, because
the yellow salt is the one adapted for Photographic use,
the other being insensible to the influence of light.</p>

<p>Iodide of Silver is tasteless and inodorous; insoluble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
water and in dilute Nitric Acid. It is scarcely dissolved by
Ammonia, which serves to distinguish it from the Chloride
of Silver, freely soluble in that liquid. Hyposulphite
of Soda and Cyanide of Potassium both dissolve Iodide
of Silver; it is also soluble in solutions of the alkaline
Bromides and Iodides, as will be further explained in
Chapter IV.</p>

<p>Iodide of Silver is reduced by Metallic Zinc in the same
manner as the Chloride of Silver, forming soluble Iodide
of Zinc and leaving a black powder.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF BROMIDE
OF SILVER.</p>

<p>This substance so closely resembles the corresponding
salts containing Chlorine and Iodine, that a short notice of
it will suffice.</p>

<p>Bromide of Silver is prepared by exposing a silvered
plate to the vapour of Bromine, or by adding solution of
Bromide of Potassium to Nitrate of Silver. It is an insoluble
substance, slightly yellow in colour, and distinguished
from Iodide of Silver by dissolving in strong
Ammonia and in Chloride of Ammonium. It is freely
soluble in Hyposulphite of Soda and in Cyanide of Potassium.</p>

<p>The properties of the element Bromine are described in
Part III.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">CHEMISTRY OF THE OXIDES OF SILVER.</p>

<p><i>The Protoxide of Silver</i> (Ag O).&mdash;If a little Potash or
Ammonia be added to solution of Nitrate of Silver, an
olive-brown substance is formed, which, on standing, collects
at the bottom of the vessel. This is Oxide of Silver,
displaced from its previous state of combination with Nitric
Acid by the stronger oxide. Potash. Oxide of Silver is
soluble to a very minute extent in pure water, the solution
possessing an alkaline reaction to Litmus; it is easily dissolved
by Nitric or Acetic Acid, forming a neutral Nitrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
or Acetate; also soluble in Ammonia (Ammonio-Nitrate of
Silver), and in Nitrate of Ammonia, Hyposulphite of Soda,
and Cyanide of Potassium. Long exposure to light converts
it into a black substance, which is probably a Suboxide.</p>

<p><i>The Suboxide of Silver</i> (Ag<sub>2</sub>O?)&mdash;This substance was
obtained by Faraday on exposing a solution of the Ammonio-Nitrate
of Silver to the action of the air. It bears a
relation to the ordinary brown Protoxide of Silver similar
to that which the Subchloride bears to Protochloride of
Silver.</p>

<p>Suboxide of Silver is a black or grey powder, which
assumes the metallic lustre on rubbing, and when treated
with dilute Acids is resolved into Protoxide of Silver which
dissolves, and metallic Silver.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On the Photographic Properties of the Salts of Silver.</i></p>

<p>In addition to the Salts of Silver described in the first
Section of this Chapter there are many others well known
to chemists, as the Acetate of Silver, the Sulphate, the Citrate
of Silver, etc. Some occur in crystals which are soluble
in water, whilst others are pulverulent and insoluble.</p>

<p>The Salts of Silver formed by colourless Acids are
white when first prepared, and remain so if kept in a dark
place; but they possess the remarkable peculiarity of being
darkened in colour by exposure to Light.</p>

<p>Action of Light upon the Nitrate of Silver.&mdash;The Nitrate
of Silver is one of the most permanent of the Silver salts.
It may be preserved unchanged in the crystalline form, or
in solution in distilled water, for an indefinite length of
time, even when constantly exposed to the diffused light
of day. This is partly explained by the nature of the acid
with which Oxide of Silver is associated in the Salt;
Nitric Acid, possessing strong oxidizing properties, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
opposed to the darkening influence of Light upon the
Silver compounds.</p>

<p>Nitrate of Silver may, however, be rendered susceptible
to the influence of Light, by adding to its solution <i>organic
matter</i>, vegetable or animal. The phenomena produced in
this case are well illustrated by dipping a pledget of cotton-wool,
or a sheet of white paper, in solution of Nitrate of
Silver, and exposing it to the direct rays of the sun; it
slowly darkens, until it becomes nearly black. The stains
upon the skin produced by handling Nitrate of Silver are
caused in the same way, and are seen most evidently when
the part has been exposed to light.</p>

<p>The varieties of organic matter which especially facilitate
the blackening of Nitrate of Silver are such as tend <i>to absorb
Oxygen</i>; hence pure vegetable fibre, free from Chlorides,
such, for instance, as the Swedish filtering-paper, is
not rendered very sensitive by being simply brushed with
solution of the Nitrate, but a little grape sugar added soon
determines the decomposition.</p>

<p><i>Decomposition of Chloride, Bromide, and Iodide of Silver
by Light.</i>&mdash;Pure moist Chloride of Silver<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> changes slowly
from white to violet on exposure to light. Bromide of Silver
becomes of a grey colour, but is less affected than the
Chloride. Iodide of Silver (if free from excess of Nitrate
of Silver) does not alter in appearance by exposure even
to the sun's rays, but retains its yellow tint unchanged.
Of these three compounds therefore <i>Chloride</i> of Silver is
the most readily acted on by light, and papers prepared
with this salt will become far darker on exposure than
others coated with Bromide or Iodide of Silver.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The Chloride here spoken of is the compound prepared by adding a
soluble Chloride to a solution of Nitrate of Silver: the product of the direct
action of Chlorine upon metallic Silver is sometimes insensitive to light.</p></div>

<p>There are certain conditions which accelerate the action
of light upon the Chloride of Silver. These are, first, <i>an
excess of Nitrate of Silver</i>, and second, <i>the presence of
organic matter</i>. Pure Chloride of Silver would be useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
as a Photographic agent, but a Chloride with excess of Nitrate
is very sensitive. Even Iodide of Silver, ordinarily
unaffected, is blackened by light when moistened with a
solution of the Nitrate of Silver.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The reader will understand that the Acetate, Sulphate, or any other
soluble Salt of Silver, might be substituted for the Nitrate in this experiment.</p></div>

<p>Organic matter combined with Chloride and Nitrate of
Silver gives a still higher degree of sensibility, and in this
way the Photographic papers are prepared.</p>

<p><i>The blackening of Chloride of Silver by Light explained.</i>&mdash;This
may be studied by suspending pure Chloride of Silver
in distilled water, and exposing it to the sun's rays for
several days. When the process of darkening has proceeded
to some extent, the supernatant liquid is found to
contain <i>free Chlorine</i>, or, in place of it. <i>Hydrochloric Acid</i>
(H Cl), the result of a subsequent action of the Chlorine
upon the water.</p>

<p>The luminous rays appear to loosen the affinity of the
elements Chlorine and Silver for each other; hence a portion
of Chlorine is separated, and the white Protochloride
is converted into the violet <i>Sub</i>chloride of Silver. If an
atom of Nitrate of Silver be present, the liberated Chlorine
unites with it, displacing Nitric Acid, and forming again
Chloride of Silver, which is decomposed in its turn. The
excess of Nitrate of Silver thus exerts an accelerating influence
upon the darkening of Chloride of Silver, by rendering
the chain of chemical affinities more complete, and
preventing an accumulation of Chlorine in the liquid, which
would be a check to the continuance of the action.</p>

<p><i>Action of Light upon organic Salts of Silver.</i>&mdash;On adding
diluted Albumen, or white of egg, to solution of Nitrate
of Silver, a flocculent deposit forms which is a compound
of the animal matter with Protoxide of Silver, and is known
as "Albuminate of Silver." This substance is at first
quite white, but on exposure to light it turns to a brick-red
colour. The change which takes place is one of <i>deoxidation</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the Protoxide of Silver losing a portion of its
Oxygen, and a Suboxide of Silver, the product of the reduction,
remaining in union with the oxidized Albumen.
The red compound may therefore be loosely designated as
an Albuminate of Suboxide of Silver.</p>

<p><i>Gelatine</i> does not precipitate Nitrate of Silver in the same
manner as Albumen: but if a sheet of transparent Gelatine
be allowed to imbibe a solution of the Nitrate, it becomes
of a clear ruby-red tint on exposure to light, and a
true chemical compound of Gelatine, or a product of its
oxidation, with a low Oxide of Silver, is produced.</p>

<p>Caseine, the animal principle of milk, is coagulated by
Nitrate of Silver, and the red substance formed on exposing
the curds to light may be viewed as analogous in composition
to the corresponding compounds with Albumen
and Gelatine.</p>

<p>Many other organic salts of Silver are darkened by light.
The white Citrate of Protoxide of Silver changes to a red
substance, reacting with chemical tests in the same manner
as Wöhler's Citrate of Suboxide of Silver, which he obtained
by reducing the ordinary Citrate in Hydrogen
Gas. Glycyrrhizin, the Sugar of Liquorice, also forms a
white compound with Oxide of Silver which becomes brown
or red in the sun's rays.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> For further particulars on the action of light upon the Salts
of Silver associated with organic matter, see the Author's paper on the
composition of the photographic image, in the eighth Chapter.</p></div>


<p class="caption4nb">SIMPLE EXPERIMENTS ILLUSTRATING THE ACTION OF LIGHT
UPON A SENSITIVE LAYER OF CHLORIDE OF SILVER ON PAPER.</p>

<p>In the performance of the most simple experiments on
the decomposition of Silver Salts by Light, the student
may employ ordinary test-tubes, in which small quantities
of the two liquids required for the double decomposition
may be mixed together.</p>

<p>When however concentrated solutions are used in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
way, the insoluble Silver Salt falls in dense and clotted
masses, which, exposed to the sun's rays, quickly blacken
on the exterior, but the inside is protected, and remains
white. It is of importance therefore in Photography that
the sensitive material should exist in the form of <i>a surface</i>,
in order that the various particles of which it is composed
may each one individually be brought into relation with
the disturbing force.</p>

<p>Full directions for the preparation of sensitive Photographic
paper are given in the second division of this work.
The following is the theory of the process:&mdash;A sheet of
paper is treated with solution of Chloride of Sodium or
Ammonium, and subsequently with Nitrate of Silver;
hence results a formation of Chloride of Silver in a fine
state of division, with an excess of Nitrate of Silver, the
Silver bath having been purposely made stronger in proportion
than the salting solution.</p>

<p><i>Illustrative Experiment No. I.</i>&mdash;Place a square of sensitive
paper (prepared according to the directions given in
the Second Part of the work) in the direct rays of the
sun, and observe the gradual process of darkening which
takes place; the surface passes through a variety of changes
in colour until it becomes of a deep chocolate-brown. If
the Light is tolerably intense, the brown shades are probably
reached in from three to five minutes; but the sensibility
of the paper, and also the nature of the tints, will
vary much with the character of the organic matter present.</p>

<p><i>Experiment No. II.</i>&mdash;Lay a device cut from black paper
upon a sheet of sensitive paper, and compress the two together
by means of a sheet of glass. After a proper length
of exposure the figure will be exactly copied, the tint
however being reversed: the black paper protecting the
sensitive Chloride beneath, produces a <i>white</i> figure upon a
dark ground.</p>

<p><i>Experiment No. III.</i>&mdash;Repeat the last experiment, substituting
a piece of lace or gauze-wire for the paper device.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
This is intended to show the minuteness with which objects
can be copied, since the smallest filament will be distinctly
represented.</p>

<p><i>Experiment No. IV.</i>&mdash;Take an engraving in which the
contrast of light and shade is tolerably well marked, and
having laid it closely in contact with the sensitive paper,
expose as before. This experiment shows that the surface
darkens in degrees proportionate to the intensity of the
light, so that the <i>half</i> shadows of the engraving are accurately
maintained, and a pleasing gradation of tone produced.</p>

<p>In the darkening of Photographic papers, the action of
the light is quite superficial, and although the black colour
may be intense, yet the amount of reduced Silver which
forms it is so small that it cannot conveniently be estimated
by chemical reagents. This is well shown by the results
of an analysis performed by the Author, in which the
total weight of Silver obtained from a blackened sheet
measuring nearly 24 by 18 inches amounted to less than
<i>half a grain</i>. It becomes therefore of great importance
in preparing sensitive paper to attend to the condition of
the surface layer of particles, the action rarely extending
to those beneath. The use of Albumen, Gelatine, etc.,
which will be explained in the eighth Chapter, has reference
to this amongst other advantages, and secures a better
and more sharply defined print.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INVISIBLE IMAGE BY
MEANS OF A REDUCING AGENT.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been shown in the previous Chapter that the majority
of the Salts of Silver, both organic and inorganic,
are darkened in colour on exposure to light, and, by the
loss of Oxygen, Chlorine, etc., become reduced to the
condition of <i>Sub</i>salts.</p>

<p>Many of the same compounds are also susceptible of a
change under the influence of light, which is even more
remarkable. This change takes place after a comparatively
short exposure, and as it does not affect the appearance
of the sensitive layer, for some time it escaped notice:
but it was afterwards discovered that an impression, before
invisible, might be brought out by treating the plate
with certain chemical agents which are without effect on
the original unchanged salt, but quickly blacken it after
exposure.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the Silver compounds most
readily affected by light alone, are not the most sensitive
to the reception of the invisible image. Thus, of Photographic
papers prepared with Chloride, Bromide, or Iodide
of Silver, the former assume the deepest shade of colour
under the influence of the sun's rays, but if all be exposed
<i>momentarily</i>, and then removed, the greatest amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
effect will be developed upon the Iodide paper. Iodide
of Silver therefore is the salt commonly used when sensibility
is an object, but it should be noted that images
nearly or quite latent can be impressed upon many other
of the compounds of Silver, including those belonging to
the animal and vegetable kingdoms.</p>

<p><i>Experiments illustrating the Formation of an Invisible
Image.</i>&mdash;Take a sheet of sensitive paper, prepared with
Iodide of Silver by the method given in the fourth Chapter
of Part II., and having divided it into two parts, expose
one of them to the luminous rays for a few seconds. No
visible decomposition takes place, but on removing the
pieces to a room dimly illuminated, and brushing with a
solution of <i>Gallic Acid</i>, a manifest difference will be observed;
the one being unaffected, whilst the other darkens
gradually until it becomes black.</p>

<p><i>Experiment II.</i>&mdash;A prepared sheet is shielded in certain
parts by an opaque substance, and then after the requisite
exposure, which is easily ascertained by a few trials, treated
with the Gallic Acid as before; in this case the protected
part remains white, whilst the other darkens to a greater
or less extent.</p>

<p>In the same way, copies of leaves, engravings, etc. may
be made, very correct in the shading and much resembling
those produced by the prolonged action of light alone upon
the Chloride of Silver.</p>

<p>The object of employing a substance like Gallic Acid to
<i>develope</i> or bring out to view an invisible image, in preference
to forming the picture by the direct action of light,
unassisted by a developer, is the <i>economy of time</i> thereby
effected. This is well shown in the results of some experiments
conducted by M. Claudet in the Daguerreotype
process: he found that with a sensitive layer of Bromo-Iodide
of Silver, an intensity of light three thousand times
greater was required if the use of a developer was omitted,
and the exposure continued until the picture became visible
upon the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>To increase the sensitiveness of Photographic preparations
is a point of great consequence; and indeed, when
the Camera is used, from the low intensity of the luminous
image formed in that instrument, no other plan than the
one above described would be practicable. Hence the advancement,
and indeed the very origin, of the Photographic
Art, may be dated from the first discovery of a process for
bringing out to view an invisible image by means of a reducing
agent.</p>

<p>The present Chapter is divided into three Sections:&mdash;first,
the chemical properties of the substances usually
employed as developers;&mdash;second, their mode of action in
reducing the Salts of Silver;&mdash;third, hypotheses on the
action of light in impressing a latent image.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Chemistry of the various Substances employed as Developers.</i></p>

<p>Development is essentially a process of <i>reduction</i>, or, in
other words, of <i>deoxidation</i>. If we take a certain metal, we
can, by means of Nitric Acid, impart Oxygen to it, so that
it becomes first an Oxide, and afterwards, by solution of
the Oxide in the excess of acid, <i>a salt</i>. When this salt is
formed, by a series of chemical operations the reverse of
the former it may be deprived of all its Oxygen, and the
metallic element again isolated.</p>

<p>The degree of facility with which oxidation as well as
reduction is performed, depends upon the affinity for Oxygen
which the particular metal under treatment possesses.
In this respect there is considerable difference, as may be
shown by a reference to the two well-known metals, Iron
and Gold. How speedily does the first become tarnished
and covered with rust, whilst the other remains bright even
in the fire! It is indeed possible, by a careful process, to
form Oxide of Gold; but it retains its Oxygen so loosely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that the mere application of heat is sufficient to drive it off,
and leave the metal in a pure state.</p>

<p>Silver, Gold, and Platinum all belong to the class of <i>noble</i>
metals, having the least affinity for Oxygen: hence their
Oxides are unstable, and any body tending strongly to
absorb Oxygen will reduce them to the metallic state.</p>

<p>Observe, therefore, that the substances employed by the
Photographer to assist the action of the light, and to develope
the picture, act by removing Oxygen. The sensitive
Salt of Silver is thus <i>reduced</i>, more or less completely, in
the parts touched by light, and an opaque deposit results
which forms the image.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> These remarks do not apply to the vapour of Mercury employed as a
developing agent in the Daguerreotype. The chemistry of that process will
be explained in a separate Chapter.</p></div>

<p>The most important of the developers are as follows:&mdash;
Gallic Acid, Pyrogallic Acid, and the <i>Proto</i>salts of Iron.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">CHEMISTRY OF GALLIC AND PYROGALLIC ACIDS.</p>

<p>a. <i>Of Gallic Acid.</i>&mdash;Gallic Acid is obtained from <i>Gall
Nuts</i>, which are peculiar excrescences formed upon the
branches and shoots of the <i>Quercus infectoria</i> by the puncture
of a species of insect. The best kind is imported
from Turkey, and sold in commerce as Aleppo Galls. Gall
Nuts do not contain Gallic Acid ready formed, but an analogous
chemical principle termed <i>Tannic Acid</i>, well known
for its astringent properties and employment in the process
of tanning raw hides.</p>

<p>Gallic Acid is produced by the <i>decomposition and oxidation</i>
of Tannic Acid when powdered galls are exposed
for a long time in a moist state to the action of the air.
By boiling the mass with water and filtering whilst hot,
the acid is extracted, and crystallizes on cooling, on account
of its sparing solubility in cold water.</p>

<p>Gallic Acid occurs in the form of long silky needles,
soluble in 100 parts of cold and 3 of boiling water; they
are also readily soluble in Alcohol, but sparingly in Ether.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
The aqueous solution becomes mouldy on keeping, to obviate
which, the addition of Acetic Acid or a drop or two
of Oil of Cloves is recommended.</p>

<p>Gallic Acid is a feeble acid, scarcely reddening litmus;
it forms salts with the alkaline and earthy bases, such as
Potash, Lime, etc., but not with the oxides of the noble
metals. When added to Oxide of Silver the metallic element
is separated and the Oxygen absorbed.</p>

<p>b. <i>Pyrogallic Acid.</i>&mdash;The term <i>pyro</i> prefixed to Gallic
Acid implies that the new substance is obtained by the
<i>action of heat</i> upon that body. At a temperature of about
410° Fahr., Gallic Acid is decomposed, and a white sublimate
forms, which condenses in lamellar crystals; this is
Pyrogallic Acid.</p>

<p>Pyrogallic Acid is very soluble in cold water, and in Alcohol
and Ether; the solution decomposes and becomes
brown by exposure to the air. It gives an indigo blue
colour with Protosulphate of Iron, which changes to dark
green if any Persulphate be present.</p>

<p>Although termed an acid, this substance is strictly <i>neutral</i>;
it does not redden litmus-paper, and forms no salts.
The addition of Potash or Soda decomposes Pyrogallic
Acid, at the same time increasing the attraction for Oxygen;
hence this mixture may conveniently be employed
for absorbing the Oxygen contained in atmospheric air.
The compounds of Silver and Gold are reduced by Pyrogallic
Acid even more rapidly than by Gallic Acid, the reducing
agent absorbing the Oxygen, and becoming converted
into Carbonic Acid and a brown matter insoluble
in water.</p>

<p>Commercial Pyrogallic Acid is often contaminated with
empyreumatic oil, and also with a black insoluble substance
known as <i>Metagallic Acid</i>, which is formed when
the heat is raised above the proper temperature in the process
of manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4nb">CHEMISTRY OF THE PROTOSALTS OF IRON.</p>

<p>The combinations of Iron with Oxygen are somewhat
numerous. There are two distinct Oxides which form Salts,
viz. the Protoxide of Iron, containing an atom of Oxygen
to one of metal; and the Peroxide, with an atom and a
half of Oxygen to one of metal. As <i>half atoms</i> however
are not allowed in chemical language, it is usual to say
that the Peroxide of Iron contains three equivalents of
Oxygen to two of metallic Iron.</p>

<p>Expressed in symbols, the composition is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
Protoxide of Iron, Fe O.<br />
Peroxide of Iron, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<br />
</p>

<p>The Proto- and Persalts of Iron do not resemble each
other in their physical and chemical properties. The former
are usually of an apple-green colour, and the aqueous
solutions almost colourless, if not highly concentrated.
The latter, on the other hand, are dark, and give a yellow
or even blood-red solution.</p>

<p>The Protosalts of Iron are alone useful in Photography;
but the following experiment will serve to illustrate the
properties of both classes of salts:&mdash;Take a crystal of Protosulphate
of Iron, and, having reduced it to powder, pour
a little Nitric Acid upon it in a test-tube. On the application
of heat, abundance of fumes will be given off, and a
red solution obtained. The Nitric Acid in this reaction
imparts Oxygen, and converts the <i>Proto</i>sulphate entirely
into a <i>Per</i>sulphate of Iron. It is this feature, viz. the
tendency to absorb Oxygen, and to pass into the state of
Persalts, which makes the Protosalts of Iron useful as
developers.</p>

<p>There are two Protosalts of Iron commonly employed by
Photographers: the Protosulphate and the Protonitrate
of Iron.</p>

<p>a. <i>Protosulphate of Iron.</i>&mdash;This salt, often termed <i>Copperas</i>
or <i>Green Vitriol</i>, is an abundant substance, and
used for a variety of purposes in the arts. Commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Sulphate of Iron however, being prepared on a large scale,
requires re-crystallization to render it sufficiently pure for
Photographic purposes.</p>

<p>Pure Sulphate of Iron occurs in the form of large transparent,
prismatic crystals, of a delicate green colour: by
exposure to the air they gradually absorb Oxygen and become
rusty on the surface. Solution of Sulphate of Iron,
colourless at first, afterwards changes to a red tint, and
deposits a brown powder; this powder is a <i>basic</i> Persulphate
of Iron, that is, a Persulphate containing an excess
of the oxide or <i>base</i>. By the addition of Sulphuric or
Acetic Acid to the solution, the formation of a deposit is
prevented, the brown powder being soluble in acid liquids.</p>

<p>The Crystals of Sulphate of Iron include a large quantity
of water of crystallization, a part of which they lose
by exposure to dry air. By a higher temperature, the
salt may be rendered perfectly <i>anhydrous</i>, in which state
it forms a white powder.</p>

<p>b. <i>Protonitrate of Iron.</i>&mdash;This salt is prepared by double
decomposition between Nitrate of Baryta or of Lead and
Protosulphate of Iron. It is an unstable substance and
crystallizes with great difficulty; its aqueous solution is
pale green at first, but very prone to decomposition, even
more so than the corresponding Sulphate of Iron.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Reduction of Salts of Silver by Developing Agents.</i></p>

<p>The general theory of the reduction of metallic oxides
having been explained, it may be desirable to enter more
minutely into the exact nature of the process as applied to
the compounds of Silver.</p>

<p>First, the Reduction of the Oxide of Silver will be
taken, as the most simple illustration; then that of
Salts of Silver formed by Oxygen-acids; and lastly, of
the Chloride, Iodide, and Bromide of Silver containing
no Oxygen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Reduction of Oxide of Silver.</i>&mdash;To illustrate this conveniently,
the Oxide of Silver should be in a state of solution;
water dissolves Oxide of Silver very sparingly, but it is
freely soluble in Ammonia, forming the liquid known as
Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver. If, therefore, a little of the
Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver be placed in a test-tube, and
solution of Sulphate of Iron be added to it, immediately
it becomes discoloured, and a deposit settles to the bottom.</p>

<p>This deposit is metallic Silver, produced by the reducing
agent appropriating to itself the Oxygen previously
combined with the metal. As metallic Silver does not
dissolve in Ammonia, the liquid becomes turbid, and the
metal subsides in the form of a bulky precipitate.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of the Oxyacid Salts of Silver.</i>&mdash;The term
<i>Oxyacid</i> includes those salts which contain the Oxide
of Silver intimately combined with Oxygen-acids; as <i>e. g.</i>
the Nitrate of Silver, the Sulphate, the Acetate of Silver,
etc.</p>

<p>These salts, soluble in water, are reduced by developing
agents in the same manner as Oxide of Silver, but more
slowly. The presence of an acid united with the base is
a hindrance to the process and tends to keep the oxide in
solution, especially when that acid is powerful in its affinities.
To illustrate the effect of the acid constituent of
the salt in retarding reduction, take two test-tubes, the
one containing Ammonio-Nitrate, and the other ordinary
Nitrate of Silver&mdash;a single drop of solution of Sulphate of
Iron added to each will indicate an evident difference in
the rapidity of deposition.</p>

<p>The precipitate of metallic Silver obtained by the action
of reducing agents upon the Nitrate, varies much in colour
and in general appearance. If Gallic or Pyrogallic Acid
be employed, it is a black powder;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> whilst the salts of
Iron, and especially the same with free Nitric Acid added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
produce a sparkling precipitate, resembling what is
termed <i>frosted silver</i>. Grape Sugar and many of the essential
oils, such as the Oil of Cloves, etc., separate the
metal from Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver in the form of a
brilliant mirror film, and are often employed in silvering
glass.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Silver precipitated by Gallic or Pyrogallic Acid does not
appear to be free from organic matter, and probably contains also a small
proportion of Oxygen.</p></div>

<p>In remarking upon these peculiarities in the molecular
condition of precipitated Silver, it should be observed that
the appearance of a metal whilst in mass is no indication of
its colour when in the state of fine powder. Platinum and
Iron, both bright metals, and susceptible of a high polish,
are dull and intensely black when in a fine state of division;
Gold is of a purple or yellowish brown; Mercury a dirty
grey.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of the Hydracid Salts of Silver.</i>&mdash;By the term
<i>Hydracid</i> is meant Salts of Silver which contain no Oxygen
or Oxygen-acids, but simply elements like Chlorine or
Iodine combined with Silver. These elements are characterized
by forming acids with Hydrogen, which acids are
hence called <i>Hydr</i>acids. Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) is an
example; so also is Hydriodic Acid (HI).</p>

<p>The reduction of the Hydracid Salts requires to be discussed
separately, because it is evidently different from
that already described; the reducing agent tending only
to absorb <i>Oxygen</i>, which is not present in these salts.
The explanation is as follows: When a Chloride of a noble
metal is reduced by a developer, <i>an atom of water</i>, composed
of Oxygen and Hydrogen, takes a part in the reaction.
The Oxygen of the water passes to the developer,
the Hydrogen to the Chlorine.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, take a solution of Chloride of Gold,
and add to it a little Sulphate of Iron. A yellow deposit
of metallic Gold soon forms, and the supernatant liquid is
found, by testing, to be acid from free Hydrochloric Acid.
The following simple diagram, in which however the <i>number</i>
of the atoms concerned is omitted, may assist the comprehension
of the change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 384px;">

</div>

<p>The symbol Au represents Gold, Cl Chlorine, H Hydrogen,
and O Oxygen. Observe that the molecules H
and O separate from each other and pass in opposite directions:
the latter unites with the Sulphate of Iron; the
former meets Cl, and produces Hydrochloric Acid (HCl),
whilst the atom of Gold is left alone.</p>

<p>Hence there is no theoretical difficulty in supposing a
reduction of Iodide of Silver by a developer, if we associate
with the Iodide an atom of water to furnish the Oxygen.
Unless the sensitive plate however has been exposed
to the light, the reduction does not readily take place; nor
can it be produced under any circumstances, with or without
light, when the whole of the free Nitrate of Silver has
been washed away from the plate. Pure Iodide of Silver
is therefore unaffected by a developer, and the compound
which blackens on the application of Sulphate of Iron
or Pyrogallic acid is an Iodide with excess of Nitrate of
Silver.</p>

</div>

<p>The mode in which a Salt of Silver, such as the Nitrate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
soluble in water, may act in facilitating the reduction of
Iodide of Silver, is shown in the preceding diagram, which
corresponds closely with the last.</p>

<p>Notice that the compound atom of Nitrate of Silver
contains a molecule of Oxygen for the developer, one of
Silver (Ag) for the separated Iodine, and an atom of Nitric
Acid (NO<sub>5</sub>), which is liberated, and takes no further
part in the change.</p>

<p>The chain of chemical affinities is more complete in this
diagram than in the last, where an atom of water only was
present, the affinity of Iodine for Silver being greater than
that of Iodine for Hydrogen. Hence it is possible that an
excess of Nitrate of Silver may, by furnishing an elementary
basis for which Iodine has an attraction, assist in
drawing off that element, so to speak, from the original
particle of Iodide of Silver touched by light.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The reader must not suppose from the remarks which have been
made in this Section that images obtained by development consist invariably
of pure metallic Silver. It can be shown that such is not the case,&mdash;that
the process of reduction is in many cases suspended when a part only of the
Oxygen has been removed; and hence results a <i>subsalt</i> similar to that
produced by the direct action of light upon organic compounds of Silver, and
differing in properties from metallic Silver. For further particulars see
the Author's Photographic researches in the eighth Chapter.</p></div>


<p class="caption3">SECTION III.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The formation and development of the Latent Image.</i></p>

<p>It was shown in the second Chapter that the continued
action of white light upon certain of the Salts of Silver resulted
in the separation of elements like Chlorine and Oxygen
and the partial reduction of the compound. We have
also seen that bodies possessing affinity for Oxygen, such
as Sulphate of Iron and Pyrogallic Acid, tend to produce
a similar effect; acting in some cases with great energy
and precipitating metallic Silver in a pure state.</p>

<p>In forming an extemporaneous theory on the production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the latent image in the Camera, it would therefore be
natural to suppose that the process consisted in setting up
a reducing action upon the sensitive surface by means of
light, afterwards to be continued by the application of the
developing solution. This idea is to a certain extent correct,
but it requires some explanation. The effects produced
by the light and the developer are not so precisely
similar that the one agency can always be substituted for
the other: an insufficient exposure in the Camera cannot
be remedied by prolonging the development of the image.
In the Photographic processes on paper it is indeed found
that a certain latitude may be allowed; but, as a rule, it
should be stated that a definite time is occupied in the
formation of the invisible image, which may not be shortened
or extended beyond its proper limits with impunity.
There is a maximum point beyond which no advance is
made; hence if the plate be not then removed from the
Camera, those portions of the image formed by the brightest
lights are speedily overtaken by the "half tones," so
that, on developing, an image appears without that contrast
between lights and shadows which is essential to the artistic
effect. On the other hand, in a case of insufficient
exposure, the feeble rays of light not having been allowed
time to impress the plate, the half shadows cannot be brought
out on subsequent treatment with the developing agent.</p>

<p>A careful study of the phenomena involved in this part
of the process cannot fail to show that the ray of Light
determines a <i>molecular</i> change of some kind in the particles
of Iodide of Silver forming the sensitive surface.
This change is not of a nature to alter the composition or
the chemical properties of the salt. The Iodine does not
leave the surface, or there would be a difference in the appearance
of the film, or in its solubility in Hyposulphite
of Soda.</p>

<p>The following diagrams may perhaps be useful in mechanically
illustrating what is meant by a molecular change.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 represents a compound molecule of Iodide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

<p>Now the effect produced on this combination by a developer
is understood, if we suppose that in the first case
the affinity of the Iodine for Silver is too great to allow of
its separation; but in the second, this affinity having been
loosened, the structure gives way, and metallic Silver is
the result.</p>

<p>This hypothesis has the merit of simplicity, and is not
opposed to known facts; it may therefore for the present
be received. The point however on which a doubt must
rest is&mdash;whether the molecular disturbance produced by
light upon Iodide of Silver leads to a reduction of that
Salt by the developer. No image can be produced on the
application of Pyrogallic Acid <i>unless the particles of Iodide
are in contact with Nitrate of Silver;</i> and hence it may
be the Nitrate and not the Iodide which is reduced&mdash;that
is, the impressed molecule of Iodide may determine the
decomposition of a contiguous particle of Nitrate, itself
remaining unchanged. This view is supported to some
extent by Moser's experiments, shortly to be quoted; and
also by the fact that the delicate image first formed can
be <i>intensified</i> by treating it with a mixture of the developing
solution and Nitrate of Silver, even after the
Iodide has been removed by a fixing agent. The following
experiment will serve to illustrate this.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Take a sensitive Collodion plate, and having impressed
an invisible image upon it by a proper exposure in the
Camera, remove it to the dark room, and pour over it the
solution of Pyrogallic Acid. When the picture has fully
appeared, stop the action by washing the plate with water,
and remove the unaltered Iodide of Silver by Cyanide of
Potassium. An examination of the image at this stage
will show that it is perfect in the details, but pale and
translucent. The plate is then to be taken back again to
the dark room and treated with fresh Pyrogallic Acid, <i>to
which Nitrate of Silver has</i> been added; immediately the
picture becomes much blacker, and continues to darken,
even to complete opacity, if the supply of Nitrate be
kept up.</p>

<p>Now in this experiment it is evident that the additional
deposit upon the image is produced from the Nitrate of
Silver, the whole of the Iodide having been previously removed.
Observe also, <i>that it forms only upon the image,
and not upon the transparent parts of the plate</i>. Even if
the Iodide, untouched by light, be allowed to remain, the
same rule holds good;&mdash;the Pyrogallic Acid and Nitrate
of Silver react upon each other and produce a metallic deposit;
this deposit however has no affinity for the unaltered
Iodide upon the part of the plate corresponding to
the shadows of the picture, but attaches itself in preference
to the Iodide already blackened by light.</p>

<p>This second stage of the development, by which a feeble
image may be strengthened and rendered more opaque, is
sometimes termed "development by precipitation," and
should be correctly understood by the practical operator.</p>

<p><i>Researches of M. Moser.</i>&mdash;The papers of M. Ludwig
Moser 'On the Formation and Development of Invisible
Images,' published in 1842, explain so clearly many remarkable
phenomena of occasional occurrence in the Collodion
and paper processes, that no apology need be offered
for referring to them somewhat at length.</p>

<p>His first proposition may be stated thus:&mdash;"If a polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
surface has been touched in particular parts by anybody,
it acquires the property of precipitating certain vapours
on these spots differently to what it does on the other
untouched parts." To illustrate this, take a thin plate of
metal, having characters <i>excised</i>; warm it gently, and lay
it upon the surface of a clean mirror glass for a few minutes:
then remove, allow to cool, and <i>breathe</i> upon the
glass, when the outlines of the device will be distinctly
seen. A plate of polished Silver may be substituted for
the glass, and in place of developing the image by the
breath, it may be brought out by Mercurial vapour.</p>

<p>The second proposition of M. Moser is as follows:&mdash;"<i>Light</i>
acts on bodies, and its influence may be tested by
vapours that adhere to the substance."&mdash;A plate of mirror
glass is exposed in the Camera to a bright and intense
light; it is then removed and breathed upon, when an
image before invisible will be developed, the breath settling
most strongly upon the parts where the light has
acted. A plate of polished Silver may be used as before
instead of glass, the vapour of Mercury or of water being
employed to develope the image. An <i>iodized Silver plate</i>
is still more sensitive to the influence of the light, and receives
a very sharp and perfect impression under the action
of the Mercury.</p>

<p>It seems therefore from these experiments and others
not quoted, that the surfaces of various bodies are capable
of being modified by contact with each other, or by contact
with a ray of light, in such a way as to impart an
affinity for a vapour; and further, that many of the Salts
of Silver are in the list of substances admitting of such
modification. But it is also evident that the same condition
of surface which causes a vapour to settle in a peculiar
manner also affects the behaviour of the Silver Salt
when treated with a reducing agent. Thus, if a clean glass
plate be touched in certain spots by the warm finger, the
impression soon disappears, but is again seen on breathing
upon the glass; and if this same plate be coated with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
very delicate layer of Iodized Collodion and passed through
the Nitrate bath, the solution of Pyrogallic acid will commonly
produce a well-defined outline of the figure even
before the plate has been exposed to the light. This experiment,
although it does not invariably succeed, is nevertheless
an instructive one, and shows the necessity of
cleaning the plates used in Photography with care. If
there be any irregularity in the manner in which the
breath settles upon the glass when it is breathed on, a
condition of surface exists at that point which will probably
so modify the layer of Iodide of Silver, that the action
of the developing fluid will be in some way interfered
with.</p>

<p>One more remarkable fact observed by M. Moser may
be quoted. He finds that the action of light upon the Daguerreotype
plate is of an <i>alternating</i> kind: it first gives
an affinity for Mercury, and then removes it. "If light
acts on Iodide of Silver," he says, "it imparts to it the
power of condensing mercurial vapours; but if it acts beyond
a certain time, it then diminishes this power and at
length takes it away altogether." This is precisely in accordance
with phenomena observed also in the Collodion
process, where the deposit of metallic Silver is sometime
less marked than usual if the plate has been exposed in the
Camera beyond the proper period of time.</p>

<p>A curious perversion of the developing process is occasionally
met with, in which on the application of the Pyrogallic
Acid, the deposit of Silver takes place upon the
<i>shadows</i> of the picture, and not upon the lights; hence on
viewing the image by transmitted light, the usual appearance
is reversed. This may perhaps be explained by an
alternating action of the light as above suggested.</p>

<p>A phenomenon at first sight even more remarkable has
occurred, in which, on developing the plate, <i>two</i> images
start out instead of one. The secondary image in such a
case is probably the remains of a previous impression
which, although apparently removed by washing, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
nevertheless modified the surface of the glass so as to
affect the layer of Iodide of Silver; and if the glass were
<i>breathed</i> upon before again coating it with Collodion, there
is every reason to suppose that the outlines of the accidental
image would be seen.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Since writing the above, the Author has perused with pleasure a paper
by Mr. Grove on the production of latent images by electricity, with a mode
of fixing them. In the experiments described, a plate of glass, electrized in
certain portions only, was breathed upon, or exposed to the fumes of Hydrofluoric
Acid. In either case the vapour settled exclusively upon the non-electrical
part of the glass, thus developing a latent image. When the plate
was first submitted to electrization, and then coated with Iodide of Silver
upon Collodion, and exposed to light,&mdash;solution of Pyrogallic Acid produced
a reduction of Silver only upon the parts of the glass corresponding to those
on which the breath settled in the previous experiment; thus indicating that
the electricity neutralized the effect of light upon the sensitive Iodide of
Silver.</p>

<p class="caption3">ON FIXING THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">A sensitive</span> layer of Chloride or Iodide of Silver on
which an image has been formed, either with or without
the aid of a developing agent, must pass through
further treatment in order to render it indestructible by
diffused light.</p>

<p>It is true that the image itself is sufficiently permanent,
and cannot be said, in correct language, to need <i>fixing</i>;
but the unchanged Silver Salt which surrounds it, being
still sensitive to light, tends to be decomposed in its turn,
and so the picture is lost. It is therefore necessary to
remove this salt by applying some chemical agent capable
of dissolving it. The list of solvents of Chloride and
Iodide of Silver has been given in Chapter II., but some
are better adapted for fixing than others. In order that
any body may be employed with success as a fixing agent,
it is required not only that it should dissolve unchanged
Chloride or Iodide of Silver, but that it should produce
no injurious effect upon the same salts reduced by light.</p>

<p>This <i>solvent action upon the image</i>, as well as upon the
parts which surround it, is most liable to happen when the
agency of light alone, without a developer, has been employed.
In that case the darkened surface, not being
reduced perfectly to the metallic state, remains soluble to
a certain extent in the fixing liquid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4nb">CHEMISTRY OF THE VARIOUS FIXING AGENTS.</p>

<p>The following will be mentioned:&mdash;Ammonia&mdash;Alkaline
Chlorides&mdash;Alkaline Iodides&mdash;Alkaline Hyposulphite&mdash;Alkaline
Cyanides.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">AMMONIA.</p>

<p>The properties of the alkaline liquid "Ammonia" are
given in Part III. Ammonia dissolves Chloride of Silver
readily, but not Iodide of Silver: hence its use is necessarily
confined to the paper proofs upon Chloride of Silver.
Even these however cannot advantageously be fixed in
Ammonia unless a deposit of Gold has been previously
produced upon the surface by a process of "toning," presently
to be explained: a peculiar and unpleasant red
tint is always caused by Ammonia acting upon the darkened
material of a sun picture as it comes from the printing-frame:
but this is obviated by the employment of the
Gold.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ALKALINE CHLORIDES, IODIDES, AND BROMIDES.</p>

<p>The Chlorides of Potassium, Ammonium, and Sodium
possess the property of dissolving a small portion of Chloride
of Silver. In the act of solution a double salt is
formed; that is, a compound of Chloride of Sodium with
Chloride of Silver, which may be crystallized out by allowing
the liquid to evaporate spontaneously.</p>

<p>The earlier Photographers employed a saturated solution
of common Salt for fixing paper prints; but the fixing
action of the Alkaline Chlorides is slow and imperfect, and
their use may now be said to be obsolete.</p>

<p>The Iodide and Bromide of Potassium have both been
used as fixing agents. They dissolve Iodide of Silver,
forming with it a double salt in the manner before described.</p>

<p>It is important to remark in the solution of the insoluble
Silver Salts by Alkaline Chlorides, Iodides, etc., that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the amount dissolved is not in proportion to the <i>quantity</i>
of the solvent, but to the degree of concentration of its
aqueous solution. This is not usual with solvents which
act by entering into chemical combination with the substance
dissolved. Commonly a given weight of the one
salt dissolves a given weight of the other, independent of
the amount of water present. The peculiarity in the case
before us depends upon the fact that the double salt
formed is <i>decomposed</i> by a large quantity of water. Hence
it is a <i>saturated</i> solution of Chloride of Sodium which
possesses the greatest power of fixing paper prints; and
with the Bromide or Iodide of Potassium the same rule
holds good&mdash;the stronger the solution the more Iodide
of Silver will be taken up. The addition of water produces
milkiness and a deposit of the silver Salt previously
dissolved.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ALKALINE HYPOSULPHITES.</p>

<p>Hyposulphurous Acid is one of the Oxides of Sulphur.
It is, as its name implies, of an acid nature, and takes its
place upon the list immediately below Sulphurous Acid
("&#965;&#961;&#959;," under).</p>

<p>The Hyposulphite of Soda commonly employed by Photographers
is a neutral combination of Hyposulphurous
Acid and the alkali Soda. It is selected as being more
economical in preparation than any other Hyposulphite
adapted for fixing.</p>

<p>Hyposulphite of Soda occurs in the form of large translucent
groups of crystals, which include five atoms of
water. These crystals are soluble in water almost to any
extent, the solution being attended with the production of
cold; they have a nauseous and bitter taste.</p>

<p>In the solution of Silver compounds by Hyposulphite of
Soda a <i>double decomposition</i> always takes place; thus:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdl">Hyposulphite of Soda</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Chloride of Silver</td>

<tr>
  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdl">Hyposulphite of Silver</td>

  <td class="tdl">Chloride of Sodium.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hyposulphite of Silver with an excess of Hyposulphite
of Soda forms a soluble double salt, which may
be crystallized out by evaporating the solution. It possesses
an intensely sweet taste, and contains one atom of
Hyposulphite of Silver, chemically combined with two of
Hyposulphite of Soda. In addition to this there is a
second double Salt, differing from the first in being <i>very
sparingly</i> soluble in water. It is formed by acting upon
Chloride of Silver with a solution of Hyposulphite of
Soda already saturated, or nearly so, with Silver Salts;
and contains single atoms of each constituent.</p>

<p>The fact that the Silver contained in an ordinary fixing
Bath is present in the state of <i>Hyposulphite</i> must be
borne in mind, because this salt is liable to undergo peculiar
chemical changes, as will be better shown in Chapter
VIII.</p>

<p>Iodide of Silver is dissolved by Hyposulphite of Soda
more slowly than Chloride of Silver, and the amount
eventually taken up is less. This is explained as follows:&mdash;
During the solution of Iodide of Silver, <i>Iodide of Sodium</i>
is formed, and this alkaline Iodide has a prejudicial effect
upon the continuance of the process. <i>Chloride</i> of Sodium
has not the same action, neither has Bromide of Sodium,
consequently the corresponding Silver Salts dissolve to a
greater extent than the Iodide.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ALKALINE CYANIDES.</p>

<p>The chemistry of Cyanogen is sketched in Part III.</p>

<p>The Cyanide of <i>Potassium</i> is the salt most frequently
employed in fixing. It occurs in commerce in the form of
fused lumps of considerable size. In this state it is usually
contaminated with a large percentage of Carbonate of
Potash, amounting in some cases to more than half its
weight. By boiling in proof Spirit the Cyanide may be
extracted and crystallized, but this operation is scarcely
required as far as its use in Photography is concerned.</p>

<p>Cyanide of Potassium absorbs moisture on exposure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the air. It is very soluble in water, but the solution decomposes
on keeping; changing in colour and evolving the
odour of <i>Prussic Acid</i>, which is a Cyanide of Hydrogen.
Cyanide of Potassium is highly poisonous, and must be
used with caution.</p>

<p>Solution of Cyanide of Potassium is a most energetic
agent in dissolving the insoluble Silver Salts: far more so,
in proportion to the quantity used, than the Hyposulphite
of Soda. The Salts are in all cases converted into Cyanides,
and exist in the solution in the form of soluble double
Salts, which, unlike the double Iodides, are not affected by
dilution with water. Cyanide of Potassium is unadapted
for fixing positive proofs upon Chloride of Silver; and
even when a developer has been used, unless the solution
is tolerably dilute, it is apt to attack the image and dissolve
it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ON THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF LIGHT.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> present Chapter is devoted to a discussion of the more
remarkable properties of Light; the object being to select
certain prominent points, and to state them as clearly as
possible, referring, for information of a more complete
kind, to acknowledged works on the subject of Optics.</p>

<p>The Chapter will be divided into five Sections:&mdash;first,
the compound nature of Light; second, the laws of refraction
of Light; third, the construction of Lenses and of
the Camera; fourth, the Photographic action of coloured
Light; fifth, on Binocular Vision and the Stereoscope.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Compound Nature of Light.</i></p>

<p>The ideas entertained on the subject of Light, before the
time of Sir Isaac Newton, were vague and unsatisfactory.
It was shown by that eminent philosopher, that a ray of
sunlight was not <i>homogeneous</i>, as had been supposed, but
consisted of several rays of vivid colours, united and intermingled.</p>

<p>This fact may be demonstrated by throwing a pencil of
Sunlight upon one angle of a <i>prism</i>, and receiving the oblong
image, so formed, upon a white screen.</p>

<p>The space illuminated and coloured by a pencil of rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
analyzed in this way is called "the Solar Spectrum." The
action of a prism in decomposing white light will be more
fully explained in the next Section. At present we notice
only that seven principal colours may be distinguished in
the Solar Spectrum, viz. red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet. Sir David Brewster has made observations
which lead him to suppose that the <i>primary</i> colours
are in reality but three in number, viz. red, yellow, and
blue, and that the others are <i>compound</i>, being produced by
two or more of these overlapping each other; thus the
red and yellow spaces intermingled constitute <i>orange</i>; the
yellow and blue spaces, <i>green</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 470px;">
<img src="images/pg47.png" width="470" height="229" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The composition of white light from the seven prismatic
colours may be roughly proved by painting them on the
face of a wheel, and causing it to rotate rapidly; this
blends them together, and a sort of greyish-white is the
result. The white is imperfect, because the colours employed
cannot possibly be obtained of the proper tints or
laid on in the exact proportions.</p>

<p>The decomposition of light is effected in other ways besides
that already given:&mdash;-</p>

<p>First, by <i>reflection</i> form the surfaces of coloured bodies.
All substances throw off rays of light, which impinge upon
the retina of the eye and produce the phenomena of vision.
Colour is caused by a <i>portion only</i>, and not the whole, of
the elementary rays, being projected in this way. Surfaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
termed <i>white</i> reflect all the rays; coloured surfaces absorb
some and reflect others: thus <i>red</i> substances reflect only
red rays, <i>yellow</i> substances, yellow rays, etc, the ray
which is reflected in all cases deciding the colour of the
substance.</p>

<p>Secondly, light may be decomposed by <i>transmission</i>
through media which are transparent to certain rays, but
opaque to others.</p>

<p>Ordinary transparent glass allows all the rays constituting
white light to pass; but by the addition of certain
metallic oxides to it whilst in a state of fusion, its properties
are modified, and it becomes <i>coloured</i>. Glass stained
by Oxide of Cobalt is permeable only to blue rays. Oxide
of Silver imparts a pure yellow tint; Oxide of Gold or
Suboxide of Copper a ruby red, etc.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">DIVISION OF THE ELEMENTARY RAYS OF WHITE LIGHT
INTO LUMINOUS, HEAT-PRODUCING, AND CHEMICAL.
RAYS.</p>

<p>The agency of Light produces a variety of distinct effects
upon the bodies which surround us. These may be classed
together as the properties of light. They are of three
kinds&mdash;the phenomena of colour and vision, of heat, and
of chemical action.</p>

<p>By resolving white light into its constituent rays, we
find that these properties are associated each one with certain
of the elementary colours.</p>

<p>The <i>yellow</i> is decidedly the most luminous ray. On examining
the Solar Spectrum, it is seen that the brightest
part is that occupied by the yellow, and that the light diminishes
rapidly on either side. So again, rooms glazed
with yellow glass always appear abundantly illuminated,
whilst the effect of red or blue glass is dark and sombre.
The yellow colour therefore constitutes that portion of
white light by which surrounding objects are rendered
visible; it is essentially the <i>visual</i> ray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>heating properties</i> of the sunlight reside principally
in the red ray, as is shown by the expansion of a mercurial
thermometer placed in that part of the spectrum.</p>

<p>The chemical action of light corresponds more to the
indigo and violet rays, and is wanting, as regards its influence
upon Iodide of Silver, both in the red and yellow.
Strictly speaking however it cannot be localized in either
of the coloured spaces, as will be more fully shown in the
Fourth Section of this Chapter, to which the reader is referred.</p>



<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Refraction of Light.</i></p>

<p>A ray of light, in its passage through any transparent
medium, travels in a straight line as long as the density
of the medium continues unchanged. But if the density
varies, becoming either greater or less, then the ray is <i>refracted</i>,
or bent out of the course which it originally pursued.
The degree to which the refraction or bending takes
place depends upon the nature of the new medium, and in
particular upon its <i>density</i> as compared with that of the
medium which the ray had previously traversed. Hence
Water refracts light more powerfully than Air, and Glass
more so than Water.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the refraction of a ray
of light.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/pg49.png" width="299" height="189" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The dotted line is drawn perpendicularly to the surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and it is seen that the ray of light on entering is bent
towards this line. On emerging, on the other hand, it is
bent to an equal extent <i>away from the perpendicular</i>, so
that it proceeds in a course parallel to, but not coincident
with, its original direction. If we suppose the new medium,
in place of being more dense than the old, to be <i>less
dense</i>, then the conditions are exactly reversed,&mdash;the ray is
bent away from the perpendicular on entering, and towards
it on leaving.</p>

<p>It must be observed that the laws of refraction apply
only to rays of light which fall upon the medium <i>at an
angle:</i> if they enter perpendicularly&mdash;in the direction of
the dotted lines in the last figure&mdash;they pass straight
through without suffering refraction.</p>

<p>Notice also, that it is <i>at the surfaces of bodies</i> that the
deflecting power acts. The ray is bent on entering, and
bent again on leaving; but whilst within the medium it
continues in a straight line. Hence it is evident that by
variously modifying the surfaces of refractive media the
rays of light may be diverted almost at pleasure. This
will be rendered clear by a few simple diagrams.</p>

<p>In the figures given below, and in the following page,
the dotted lines represent perpendiculars to the surface at
the point where the ray falls, and it is seen that the usual
law of bending <i>towards</i> the perpendicular on entering, and
away from it on leaving the dense medium, is in each case
correctly observed.</p>

<p><i>The various forms of Lenses.</i>&mdash;The phenomena of the
refraction of light are seen in the case of curved surfaces
in the same manner as with those which are plane.</p>

<p>Glasses ground of a curvilinear form are termed <i>Lenses</i>.
The following are examples.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 is a biconvex lens; fig. 2, a biconcave lens; and
fig. 3, a <i>meniscus</i> lens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as regards their refractive powers, such figures
may be represented, nearly, by others bound by straight
lines, and thus it becomes evident that a biconvex lens
tends to condense rays of light to a point, and a biconcave
to scatter them. A meniscus combines both actions, but
the rays are eventually bent together, the convex curve of
a meniscus lens being always greater than the concave.</p>

<p><i>The Foci of Lenses.</i>&mdash;It has been shown that convex
lenses tend to condense rays of light and bring them together
to a point. This point is termed "the focus" of
the Lens.</p>

<p>The following laws as regards the focus may be laid
down:&mdash;</p>

<p>That rays of light which are pursuing a parallel course
at the time they enter the Lens are brought to a focus at a
point nearer to the Lens than diverging rays. The rays
proceeding from very distant objects are parallel; those
from objects near at hand diverge. The sun's rays are
always parallel, and the divergence of the others becomes
greater as the distance from the Lens is less.</p>

<p>The focus of a Lens for parallel rays is termed the "principal
focus," and is not subject to variation; this is the
point referred to when the <i>focal length</i> of a Lens is spoken
of. When the rays are not parallel, but diverge from a
point, that point is associated with the focus, and the two
are termed "conjugate foci."</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/pg52.png" width="432" height="131" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the above diagram A is the principal focus, and B
and C are conjugate foci. Any object placed at B has its
focus at G, and conversely when placed at C it is in focus
at B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, although the principal focus of a Lens (as determined
by the degree of its convexity) is always the same,
yet the focus for objects near at hand varies, being longer
as they are brought closer to the Lens.</p>

<p><i>Formation of a Luminous Image by a Lens.</i>&mdash;As the
rays of light proceeding from a point are brought to a
focus by means of a Lens, so are they when they proceed
from an object, and in that case <i>an image of the object</i> is
the result.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/pg53.png" width="418" height="237" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The above figure illustrates this. The size of the image
varies with the distance of the arrow from the glass&mdash;being
larger and formed at a point further from the Lens
as the object is brought nearer. The refracting power of
the Lens also influences the result&mdash;lenses of short focal
length, <i>i. e.</i> more convex, giving a smaller image.</p>

<p>In order that the course pursued by pencils of rays proceeding
from an object may be easily traced, the lines from
the barb of the arrow in the last figure are <i>dotted</i>. Observe
that the object is necessarily <i>inverted</i>, and also that those
rays which traverse the central point of the Lens, or the
centre of the <i>axis</i>, as it is termed, are not bent away, but
pursue a course either coincident with, or parallel to, the
original, as in the case of refracting media with parallel
surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION III.</p>

<p class="tdc">The Photographic Camera.</p>

<p>The Photographic Camera is in its essential nature an
extremely simple instrument. It consists merely of a <i>dark
chamber</i>, having an aperture in front in which a Lens is
inserted. The accompanying figure shows the simplest
form of Camera.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/pg54.png" width="359" height="141" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The body is represented as consisting of two portions
which slide within each other; but the same object of
lengthening or shortening the focal distance may be attained
by making the Lens itself movable. A luminous
image of any object placed in front of the Camera is formed
by means of the Lens, and received upon a surface of
ground glass at the back part of the instrument. When
the Camera is required for use, the object is <i>focussed</i> upon
the ground glass, which is then removed, and a slide containing
the sensitive layer inserted in its place.</p>

<p>The luminous image, as formed upon the ground glass,
is termed the "Field" of the Camera; it is spoken of as
being flat or curved, sharp or indistinct, etc. These and
other peculiarities which depend upon the construction of
the Lens will now be explained.</p>

<p><i>Chromatic Aberration of Lenses.</i>&mdash;The outside of a biconvex
lens is strictly comparable with the sharp edge of
a <i>prism</i>, and therefore necessarily produces decomposition
in the white light which passes through it.</p>

<p>The action of a prism in separating white light into its
constituent rays may be simply explained;&mdash;all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
coloured rays are refrangible, but not to the same extent.
The indigo and violet are more so than the yellow and red,
and consequently they are separated from them, and occupy
a higher position in the Spectrum. (See the diagram
at <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>.)</p>

<p>A little reflection will show that in consequence of this
unequal refrangibility of the coloured rays, white light
must invariably be decomposed on entering any dense
medium. This is indeed the case; but if the surfaces of
the medium <i>are parallel to each other</i> the effect is not
seen, because the rays recombine on their emergence,
being bent to the same extent in the opposite direction.
Hence light is transmitted colourless through an ordinary
pane of glass, but yields the tints of the Spectrum in its
passage through a prism or a lens, where the two surfaces
are inclined to each other at an acute angle.</p>

<p>Chromatic aberration is corrected by combining two
lenses cut from varieties of glass which differ in their
power of separating the coloured rays. These are the
dense flint-glass containing Oxide of Lead, and the light
crown-glass. Of the two lenses, the one is <i>biconvex</i>, and
the other <i>biconcave</i>; so that when fitted together they
produce a compound Achromatic lens of a meniscus form,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/pg55.png" width="326" height="114" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first Lens in this figure is the flint- and the second
the crown-glass. Of the two the biconvex is the most
powerful, so as to overcome the other, and produce a total
of refraction to the required extent. Each of the Lenses
produces a spectrum of a different length; and the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of passing the rays through both, is, by overlapping the
coloured spaces, to unite the complementary tints, and to
form again white light.</p>

<p>Spherical Aberration of Lenses.&mdash;The field of a Camera
is not often equally sharp and distinct at every part. If
the centre be rendered clear and well defined, the outside
is misty; whilst, by slightly altering the position of the
ground glass, so as to define the outside portion sharply,
the centre is thrown out of focus. Opticians express this
by saying that there is a want of proper flatness of field;
two causes may be mentioned as concurring to produce it.</p>

<p>The first is "spherical aberration," by which is meant
the property possessed by Lenses which are segments
of spheres, of refracting rays of light unequally at different
parts of their surfaces. The following diagram
shows this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/pg56.png" width="297" height="143" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Observe that the dotted lines which fall upon the circumference
of the Lens are brought to a focus at a point
nearer to the Lens than those passing through the centre;
in other words, the outside of the Lens refracts light the
most powerfully. This causes a degree of confusion and
indistinctness in the image, from various rays crossing, and
interfering with, each other.</p>

<p>Spherical aberration may be avoided by increasing the
convexity of the centre part of the Lens, so as to add to its
refracting power at that particular point. The surface is
then no longer a segment of a sphere, but of an ellipse,
and refracts light more equally. The difficulty of grinding
Lenses to an elliptical form however is so great, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
spherical Lens is still used, the aberration being corrected
in other ways.</p>

<p>A second cause interfering with the distinctness of the
outer portions of the image in the Camera is the obliquity
of some rays proceeding from the object; in consequence
of which the image has a curved form, with the concavity
inwards, as may be seen by referring to the figure given at
<a href="#Page_53">page 53</a>. The following diagram is meant to explain curvature
of the image.</p>

<p>The centre line running at right angles to the general
direction of the Lens is the axis; an imaginary line, on
which the Lens may be said to rotate as a wheel turns
on its axle. The lines A A represent rays of light falling
parallel to the axis; and the dotted lines, others which
have an oblique direction; B and C show the points at
which the two foci are formed. Observe that these points,
although equidistant from the centre of the Lens, do not
fall in the same vertical plane, and therefore they cannot
both be received distinct upon the ground glass of the
Camera, which would occupy the position of the perpendicular
double line in the diagram. Hence it is that with
most lenses, when the centre of the field has been focussed,
the glass must be shifted forwards a little to define
the outside sharply.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/pg57.png" width="352" height="186" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>The Use of Stops in Lenses.</i>&mdash;Curvature of the image
and indistinctness of outline from spherical aberration are
both remedied to a great extent by fixing in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Lens a diaphragm having a small central aperture. The
diagram gives a sectional view of a Lens with a "stop"
attached; the exact position it should occupy with reference
to the Lens is a point of importance, and influences
the flatness of the field.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/pg58.png" width="202" height="124" alt="" />
</div>

<p>By using a diaphragm the quantity of light admitted
into the Camera is diminished in proportion to the size
of the aperture. The image is therefore less brilliant, and
a longer exposure of the sensitive plate is required. In
other respects however the result is improved; the spherical
aberration is lessened by cutting off the outside of the
Lens, and a portion of the oblique rays being intercepted,
the focus of the remainder is lengthened out, and the image
is rendered flatter, and improved in distinctness. Hence
also, when a small stop is affixed to a Lens, a variety of
objects, situated at different distances, are all in focus at
once; whereas, with the full aperture of the Lens, objects
near at hand cannot be rendered distinct upon the ground
glass at the same time with distant objects, or <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Double or Portrait Combination of Achromatic
Lenses.</i>&mdash;The brightness of illumination of an image formed
by a Lens is in proportion to the diameter of the Lens, that
is, to the size of the aperture by which the Light is admitted.
The <i>clearness or distinctness of outline</i> however
is independent of this, being improved by using a stop,
which lessens the diameter.</p>

<p>The Portrait combination of Lenses is constructed to
ensure rapidity of action by admitting a large volume of
light. The following diagram gives a sectional view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/pg59.png" width="254" height="167" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In this combination the front Lens is an Achromatic
plano-convex, with, the convex side turned toward the object;
and the second, which takes up the rays and refracts
them further, is a compound Biconvex Lens; there are
therefore in all four distinct glasses concerned in forming
the image, which may appear at first to be an unnecessarily
complex arrangement. It is found however that a good
result cannot be secured by using a single Lens, when a
"stop" is inadmissible. By combining two glasses of
different curves, the aberrations of one correct those of
the other to a great extent, and the field is both flatter and
more distinct than in the case of an Achromatic Meniscus
employed without a diaphragm.</p>

<p>The manufacture of Portrait Lenses is a point of great
difficulty, the glasses requiring to be ground with extreme
care, in order to avoid <i>distortion</i> of the image: hence the
most rapid Portrait Lenses, having large aperture and short
focus, are often useless unless purchased of a good maker.</p>

<p><i>The Variation between the Visual and Actinic Foci in
Lenses.</i>&mdash;The same causes which produce chromatic aberration
in a Lens, tend also to separate the chemical from
the visual focus.</p>

<p>The violet and indigo rays are more strongly bent in than
the yellow, and still more than the red; consequently the
focus for each of those colours is at a different point. The
following diagram shows this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/pg60.png" width="281" height="105" alt="" />
</div>

<p>V represents the focus of the violet ray, Y of the yellow,
and E of the red.</p>

<p>Hence, as the chemical action corresponds more to the
violet, the most marked actinic effect would be produced
at V. The luminous portion of the spectrum however is
<i>the yellow</i>, consequently the visual focus is at Y.</p>

<p>Photographers have long recognized this point; and
therefore, with ordinary Lenses, not corrected for colour,
rules are laid down as to the exact distance which the sensitive
plate should be shifted away from the visual focus
in order to obtain the greatest amount of distinctness of
outline in the image impressed by chemical action.</p>

<p>These rules do not apply to the Achromatic Lenses recently
described. The coloured rays being in that case
bent together again and reunited, the two foci also nearly
correspond. By a little further correction to a point higher
in the Spectrum, they are made to do so perfectly.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION IV.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On the Photographic Action of Coloured Light.</i></p>

<p>It has already been mentioned in the First Section of
this Chapter that certain of the elementary colours of white
light, viz. the violet and indigo, are peculiarly active in
decomposing the Photographic Salts of Silver; but there
are some points of importance relating to the same subject
which require a further notice.</p>

<p>The term "actinism" (Gr. &#7937;&#954;&#964;&#7985;&#962;, a ray or flash) has
been proposed as convenient to designate the property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
possessed by light of producing chemical change; the rays
to which the effect is especially due being known as actinic
rays.</p>

<p>If the pure Solar Spectrum formed by prismatic analysis
in the manner represented at <a href="#Page_47">page 47</a> be allowed to impinge
upon a prepared sensitive surface of Iodide of Silver, the
latent image being subsequently developed by a reducing
agent, the effect produced will be something similar to
that represented in the following diagram:&mdash;</p>


<table summary="figures">
<tr>
  <td><img src="images/pg61fig1.png" width="243" height="197" alt="" /></td>
  <td><img src="images/pg61fig2.png" width="246" height="196" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="fig_caption">Fig. 1.</td>
  <td class="fig_caption">Fig. 2.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>Fig. 1 shows the visible spectrum as it appears to the
eye; the brightest part being in the yellow space, and the
light gradually shading off until it ceases to be seen. Fig.
2 represents the chemical effect produced by throwing the
Spectrum upon Iodide of Silver. Observe that the darkening
characteristic of chemical action is most evident in
the upper spaces, where the light is feeble, and is altogether
absent at the point corresponding to the bright yellow spot
of the visible spectrum. The actinic and luminous spectra
are therefore totally distinct from each other, and the word
"Photography," which signifies the process of taking pictures
by light, is in reality inaccurate.</p>

<p>To those who have not the opportunity of working with
the Solar Spectrum, the following experiments will be
useful in illustrating the Photographic value of coloured
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Experiment I.</i>&mdash;Take a sheet of sensitive paper prepared
with Chloride of Silver, and lay upon it strips of blue,
yellow, and red glass. On exposure to the sun's rays for
a few minutes, the part beneath the blue glass darkens
rapidly, whilst that covered by the red and yellow glass is
perfectly protected. This result is the more striking from
the extreme <i>transparency</i> of the yellow glass, giving the
idea that the Chloride would certainly be blackened first
at that point. On the other hand, the blue glass appears
very dark, and effectually conceals the tissue of the paper
from view.</p>

<p><i>Experiment II.</i>&mdash;Select a vase of flowers of different
shades of scarlet, blue, and yellow, and make a Photographic
copy of them, by development, upon Iodide of
Silver. The blue tints will be found to act most violently
upon the sensitive compound, whilst the reds and yellows
are scarcely visible; were it not that it is difficult to procure
in nature pure and homogeneous tints, free from admixture
with other colours, they would make no impression
whatever upon the plate.</p>

<p>In exemplifying further the importance of distinguishing
between visual and actinic rays of light, we may observe
that if the two were in all respects the same. Photography
must cease to exist as an Art. It would be impossible to
make use of the more sensitive chemical preparations from
the difficulties which would attend the previous preparation
and subsequent development of the plates. These
operations are now conducted in what is termed a dark
room; but it is dark only in a <i>Photographic</i> sense, being
illuminated by means of yellow light, which, whilst it enables
the operator easily to watch the progress of the work,
produces no injurious effect upon the sensitive surfaces.
If the windows of the room were glazed with <i>blue</i> in
place of yellow glass, then it would be strictly a "dark
room," but one altogether unfitted for the purpose intended.</p>

<p>Another point connected with the same subject and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
worthy of note is&mdash;the extent to which the sensibility of
the Photographic compounds is influenced by atmospheric
conditions not visibly interfering with the <i>brightness</i> of
the light. It is natural to suppose that those days on which
the sun's rays are the most powerful would be the best
for rapid impression, but such is not by any means the
case. If the light is at all of a yellow cast, however bright
it may be, its actinic power will be small.</p>

<p>It will also be often observed in working towards the
evening, that a sudden diminution of sensibility in the
plates begins to be perceptible at a time when but little
difference can be detected in the brilliancy of the light;
the setting sun has sunk behind a golden cloud, and all
chemical action is soon at an end.</p>

<p>In the same manner is explained the difficulty of obtaining
Photographs in the glowing light of tropical climates;
the superiority Of the early months of spring over those
of the midsummer; of the morning sun to that of the
afternoon, etc. April and May are usually considered the
best months for rapid impression in this country; but the
light continues good until the end of July. In August
and September a longer exposure of the plates will be required.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE SUPERIOR SENSIBILITY OF BROMIDE OF SILVER TO COLOURED LIGHT.</p>

<p>In copying the Solar Spectrum alternately upon a surface
of Iodide and Bromide of Silver, we notice a difference
in the Photographic properties of these two salts. The
latter is affected more extensively, to a point lower in the
spectrum, than the former. In the case of the Iodide
of Silver, the action ceases in the Blue space; but with
the Bromide it reaches to the Green. This is shown in
the following diagrams, which are drawn from the observations
of Mr. Crookes ('Photographic Journal,' vol. i.
p. 100):&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 245px;">
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 1.<span style="padding: 0 1.5em;">Fig. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fig. 3.</div>
<img src="images/pg64.png" width="231" height="381" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 1 represents the chemical spectrum on Bromide of
Silver; fig. 2, the same upon Iodide of Silver; and fig. 3,
the visible spectrum.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be supposed that the superior sensibility
of the Bromide of Silver to green rays of light would
render that salt useful to the Photographer in copying landscape
scenery; and indeed it is the opinion of many that,
in the <i>Calotype</i> paper process, the dark colour of foliage
is better rendered by a mixture of Bromide and Iodide of
Silver than by the latter salt alone. This however cannot
depend upon the greater sensibility of the Bromide to
coloured light, as may easily be proved.&mdash;</p>

<p>The diagrams given above are shaded to represent nearly,
the relative intensity of the chemical action exerted by the
rays at different points of the spectrum; and on referring
to them it will be seen that the maximum point of blackness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is in the indigo and violet space, the action being more
feeble in the blue space lower down; there are also highly
refrangible rays extending upwards far beyond the visible
colours, and these invisible rays are actively concerned in
the formation of the image.</p>

<p>It is evident therefore that the amount of effect produced
by a pure green, or even a light blue tint, upon a
surface of Bromide of Silver is very small as compared
with that of an indigo or violet; and hence, as in copying
natural objects radiations of all kinds are present at the
same time, the green tints have not time to act before the
image is impressed by the more refrangible rays.</p>

<p>Sir John Herschel proposed to render coloured light
more available in Photography by separating the actinic
rays of high refrangibility, and working only with those
which correspond to the blue and green spaces in the
spectrum. This may be done by placing in front of the
Camera a vertical glass trough containing a solution of
Sulphate of Quinine. Professor Stokes has shown that
this liquid possesses curious properties. In transmitting
rays of light it <i>modifies</i> them so that they emerge <i>of lower
refrangibility</i>, and incapable of producing the same actinic
effect. Sulphate of Quinine is, if we may use the term,
<i>opaque</i> to all actinic rays higher than the blue-coloured
space. The proposition of Sir John Herschel above referred
to was therefore to employ a bath of Sulphate of
Quinine, and having eliminated the actinic rays of high
refrangibility, to work upon Bromide of Silver with those
corresponding to the lower-coloured spaces. In this way
he conceived that a more natural effect might be obtained.</p>

<p>If Photographic compounds should be discovered of
greater sensibility than any we at present possess, the
use of the Quinine bath will perhaps be adopted; but at
present we trust to the superior intensity of the invisible
rays for the formation of the image, and hence the employment
of Bromide of Silver is less strongly indicated.</p>

<p>These remarks apply to Photographs taken by sunlight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Mr. Crookes states that in working with artificial light,
such as gas or camphine, the case is different. Actinic
rays of high refrangibility are comparatively wanting in
gas-light, the great bulk of the Photographic rays beings
found to lie within the limits of the visible spectrum, and
consequently acting more energetically upon Bromide than
on Iodide of Silver.</p>

<p><i>Explanation of the mode in which Coloured Objects impress
the Sensitive Film.</i>&mdash;The fact of which we have been
speaking, viz. that the natural colours are not always correctly
represented in photography, is often urged in depreciation
of the art,&mdash;"when lights, are represented by shadows,"
it is said, "how can a truthful picture be expected?"
The insensitiveness of Iodide of Silver to the colours occupying
the lower portion of the spectrum would indeed
present an insuperable difficulty <i>if the tints of Nature were
pure and homogeneous:</i> such however is not the case. Even
the most sombre colours are accompanied by scattered
rays of white light in quantity amply sufficient to affect
the sensitive film.</p>

<p>This is especially seen when the coloured body <i>possesses
a good reflecting surface;</i> and hence some varieties of foliage,
as for instance the Ivy, with its smooth and polished
leaf, are more easily photographed than others. So again
with regard to drapery in the department of portraiture&mdash;it
is necessary to attend not only to the colour, but also to
the material of which it is composed. Silks and satins are
favourable, as reflecting much light, whilst velvets and
coarse stuffs of all kinds, if at all dark, produce very little
effect upon the sensitive film.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION V.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On Binocular Vision and the Stereoscope.</i></p>

<p>An object is said to be "stereoscopic" (&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#959;&#987; solid,
and &#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#969;, I see) when it stands out in relief, and gives
to the eye the impression of solidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>This subject was first explained by Professor Wheatstone
in a memoir on binocular vision, published in the
'Philosophical Transactions' for 1838; in which he shows
that solid bodies project different perspective figures upon
each retina, and that the illusion of solidity may be artificially
produced by means of the "Stereoscope."</p>

<p>The phenomena of binocular vision may be simply
sketched as follows:&mdash;If a cube, or a small box of an oblong
form, be placed at a short distance in front of the
observer, and viewed attentively with the right and left
eye separately and in succession, it will be found that the
figure perceived in the two cases is different; that each eye
sees more of one side of the box, and less of the other;
and that in neither instance is the effect exactly the same
as that given by the two eyes employed conjointly.</p>

<p>A silver pencil-case, or a pen-holder, may be used to
illustrate the same fact. It should be held at about six or
eight inches distant from the root of the nose, and quite
at right angles to the face, so that the length of the pencil
is concealed by the point. Then, whilst it remains fixed
in this position, the left and right eye are to be alternately
closed: in each case a portion of the opposite side of the
pencil will be rendered visible.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/pg67.png" width="440" height="242" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 1.<span style="padding: 0 6em;">&nbsp;</span>Fig. 2.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The preceding diagrams exhibit the appearance of a bust
as seen by each eye successively.</p>

<p>Observe that the second figure, which represents the
impression received by the right eye, is more of a full face
than fig. 1, which, being viewed from a point removed a
little to the left, partakes of the character of a profile.</p>

<p>The human eyes are placed about 2&frac12; inches, or from
that to 2<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches, asunder; hence it follows that, the points
of sight being separated, a <i>dissimilar</i> image of a solid object
is formed by each eye. We do not however see two
images, but a single one, which is stereoscopic.</p>

<p>In looking at a picture painted on a flat surface the case
is different: the eyes, as before, form two images, but
these images are in every respect similar; consequently
the impression of solidity is wanting. A single picture,
therefore, cannot be made to appear stereoscopic. To convey
the illusion <i>two</i> pictures must be employed, the one
being a right and the other a left perspective projection
of the object. The pictures must also be so arranged, that
each is presented to its own eye, and that the two appear
to proceed from the same spot.</p>

<p>The reflecting stereoscope, employed to effect this, forms
<i>luminous images</i> of the binocular pictures, and throws
these images together, so that, on looking into the instrument,
only a single image is seen, in a central position. It
should, however, be understood, that no optical arrangement
of any kind is indispensably required, since it is quite
possible, with a little effort, to combine the two images
by the unaided organs of vision. The following diagram
will make this obvious:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/pg68.png" width="297" height="72" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The circles A and B represent two wafers, which are
stuck on paper at a distance of about three inches from
each other. They are then viewed by <i>squinting</i> strongly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
or turning the eyes inwards towards the nose, until the
right eye looks at the left wafer, and the left eye at the
right wafer. Each wafer will then appear to become double,
four images being seen, the two central of which will gradually
approach each other until they coalesce. Stereoscopic
pictures, properly arranged, may be examined in the
same manner; and it will be found that the resultant solid
image is formed midway, at a point where two lines, drawn
across from the eyes to the pictures, cut one another. The
experiment here mentioned is sometimes a painful one,
and cannot easily be made if the eyes are not of equal
strength; but it will serve to show that the essential principle
resides in the binocular representation of the object,
and not in the instrument employed to view it.</p>

<p>In Mr. Wheatstone's reflecting Stereoscope <i>mirrors</i> are
used. The principle of the instrument is as follows:&mdash;
objects placed in front of a mirror have their reflected
images apparently <i>behind</i> the mirror. By arranging two
mirrors at a certain inclination to each other, the images
of the double picture may be made to approach until they
coalesce, and the eye perceives a single one only. The
following diagram will explain this.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/pg69.png" width="203" height="213" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The rays proceeding from the star on either side pass
in the direction of the arrows, being thrown off from the
mirror (represented by the thick black line) and entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the eyes at R and L. The reflected images appear behind
the mirror, uniting at the point A.</p>

<p>The reflecting Stereoscope is adapted principally for
viewing large pictures. It is a very perfect instrument,
and admits of a variety of adjustments, by which the apparent
size and distance of the Stereoscopic image may be
varied almost at pleasure.</p>

<p>The "lenticular" Stereoscope of Sir David Brewster is
a more portable form of apparatus. A sectional view is
given in the diagram.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 282px;">
<img src="images/pg70.png" width="282" height="309" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The brass tubes to which the eyes of the observer are
applied contain each a semi-lens, formed by dividing a
common lens through the centre and cutting each half into
a circular form (fig. 1 in the following page). The half-lens
viewed in section (fig. 2) is therefore of a prismatic
shape, and when placed with its sharp edge as in the diagram
above, alters the direction of the rays of light proceeding
from the picture, bending them outwards or away
from the centre, so that in accordance with well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
optical laws they appear to come in the direction of the
dotted lines in the diagram (in the last page), and the two
images coalesce at their point of junction. In the instrument
as it is often sold, one of the lenses is made movable,
and by turning it round with the finger and thumb it
will be seen that the positions of the images may be shifted
at pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Rules for taking Binocular Photographs.</i>&mdash;In viewing
very distant objects with the eyes, the images formed on
the retinæ are not sufficiently dissimilar to produce a very
Stereoscopic effect; hence it is often required, in taking binocular
pictures, to separate the Cameras more widely than
the two eyes are separated, in order to give a sufficient appearance
of relief. Mr. Wheatstone's original directions
were, to allow about one foot of separation for each twenty-five
feet of distance, but considerable latitude may be
permitted.</p>

<p>If the Cameras be not placed far enough apart, the dimensions
of the stereoscopic image from before backwards
will be too small,&mdash;statues looking like bas-reliefs, and the
circular trunks of trees appearing oval, with the long diameter
transverse. On the other hand, when the separation
is too wide, the reverse obtains,&mdash;objects for instance
which are square, assuming an oblong shape pointing towards
the observer.</p>

<p>To understand the cause of this, the following law in
optics should be studied:&mdash;"The distance of objects is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
estimated by the extent to which the axes of the eyes must
be converged to view them." If we have to turn our eyes
strongly inwards, we judge the object to be near; but if
the eyes remain nearly parallel, we suppose it to be distant.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/pg72.png" width="275" height="113" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The above figures represent six-sided truncated pyramids,
each with its apex towards the observer, the centres
of the two smaller interior hexagons being more widely
separated than those of the larger exterior ones. By converging
the eyes upon them so as to unite the central images
in the manner represented in <a href="#Page_68">page 68</a> a greater amount
of convergence will be required to bring together the two
summits than the bases, and hence the summits will appear
the nearest to the eye; that is to say, the resultant central
figure will acquire the additional dimension of <i>height</i>, and
appear as a solid cone, standing perpendicularly upon its
base: further, the more widely the summits are separated
in relation to the bases, the taller will the cone be, although
a greater effort will be required to coalesce the
figures.</p>

<p>Binocular Photographs taken with too much separation
of the Cameras, are distorted from a similar cause,&mdash;so
strong a convergence being required to unite them that
certain parts of the picture appear to approach near to the
eye; and the depth of the solid image is increased.</p>

<p>This effect is most observable when the picture embraces
a variety of objects, situated in different planes. In the
case of views which are quite distant, no near objects being
admitted, the Cameras may be placed with especial reference
to them, even as far as twelve feet apart, without
producing distortion.</p>

<p>It is sometimes observable, in looking at Stereoscopic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
pictures, that they convey an erroneous impression of
the real size and distance of the object. For instance,
in using the large reflecting Stereoscope, if, when the adjustments
have been made and the images properly united,
the two pictures be moved slowly forward, the eyes remaining
fixed upon the mirrors, the Stereoscopic image
will gradually change its character, the various objects it
embraces appearing to become diminished in size, and approaching
near to the observer: whilst if the pictures be
pushed <i>backwards</i>, the image will enlarge and recede to a
distance. So, again, if an ordinary slide for the lenticular
Stereoscope be divided in the centre, and, looking into
the instrument until the images coalesce, the two halves
be slowly separated from each other, the solid picture will
seem to become larger and to recede from the eye.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand the cause of this. When the
pictures in the reflecting Stereoscope are moved <i>forwards</i>,
the convergence of the optic axes is increased: the image
therefore appears <i>nearer</i>, in accordance with the last-mentioned
law. But to convey the impression of nearness is
equivalent to an apparent diminution in size, for we judge
of the dimensions of a body very much in relation to its
supposed distance. Of two figures, for instance, appearing
of the same height, one known to be a hundred yards off
might be considered colossal, whilst the other, obviously
near at hand, would be viewed as a statuette.</p>

<p>These facts, with others not mentioned, are of great interest
and importance, but their further consideration does
not fall within the bounds originally prescribed to us. The
practical details of Stereoscopic Photography have been
arranged in a distinct Section, and will be found included
in the Second Part of the Work.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p class="caption3">THE PHOTOGRAPHIC PROPERTIES OF IODIDE OF SILVER
UPON COLLODION.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding part of this Work the physical and chemical
properties of Chloride and Iodide of Silver have
been described, with the changes which they experience
by the action of Light. Nothing however has been said
of the surface used to support the Iodide of Silver, and to
expose it in a finely divided state to the influence of the
actinic radiations. This omission will now be supplied,
and the use of Collodion will engage our attention.</p>

<p>The sensibility of Iodide of Silver upon Collodion is
greatly superior to that of the same salt employed in conjunction
with any other vehicle at present known. Hence
the Collodio-Iodide film will supersede the paper and Albumen
processes in all cases where objects liable to move
are to be copied. The causes of this superior sensitiveness,
as far as ascertained, may be referred to the state of
<i>loose coagulation</i> of a Collodion film and other particulars
presently to be noticed. It must however be allowed
that there are yet some points affecting the sensitiveness
of Iodide of Silver, both mechanical and chemical, of the
exact nature of which we are ignorant.</p>

<p>The present Chapter may be divided into four Sections:&mdash;the
nature of Collodion; the chemistry of the Nitrate
Bath; the causes affecting the formation and development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the Image upon Collodion; the various irregularities in
the development of the Image.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Collodion.</i></p>

<p>Collodion (so named from the Greek word &#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#7937;&#969;, to
<i>stick</i>) is a glutinous, transparent fluid, procured, as generally
said, by dissolving Gun-Cotton in Ether. It was
originally used for surgical purposes only, being smeared
over wounds and raw surfaces, to preserve them from
contact with the air by the tough film which it leaves on
evaporation. Photographers employ it to support a delicate
film of Iodide of Silver upon the surface of a smooth
glass plate.</p>

<p>Two elements enter into the composition of Collodion:
first, the Gun-Cotton; second, the fluids used to dissolve
it. Each of these will be treated in succession.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">CHEMISTRY OF PYROXYLINE.</p>

<p>Gun-Cotton or <i>Pyroxyline</i> is Cotton or Paper which has
been altered in composition and properties by treatment
with strong acids.</p>

<p>Both Cotton and Paper are, chemically, the same. They
consist of fibres which are found on analysis to have a
constant composition, containing three elementary bodies,
Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, united together in fixed
proportions. To this combination the term <i>Lignine</i> or
<i>Cellulose</i><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> has been applied.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Lignine and Cellulose are not precisely identical substances. The latter
is the material composing the cell-wall; the former, the contained matter in
the cell.</p></div>

<p>Cellulose is a definite chemical compound, in the same
sense as Starch or Sugar, and consequently, when treated
with various reagents, it exhibits properties peculiar to
itself. It is insoluble in most liquids, such as Water,
Alcohol, Ether, etc., and also in dilute acids; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
acted upon by Nitric Acid of a certain strength it liquefies
and dissolves.</p>

<p>It has been already shown (<a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>) that when a body
dissolves in Nitric Acid the solution is not usually of
the same nature as an aqueous solution; and so in this
case&mdash;the Nitric Acid imparts Oxygen first to the Cotton,
and afterwards dissolves it.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of Pyroxyline.</i>&mdash;If, instead of treating
Cotton with Nitric Acid, a mixture of Nitric and Sulphuric
Acids in certain proportions be used, the effect is
peculiar. The fibres contract slightly, but undergo no
other visible alteration. Hence we are at first disposed to
think the mixed Acids ineffectual. This idea however is
not correct, since on making the experiment the properties
of the cotton are found to be changed. Its weight has
increased by more than one-half; it has become soluble in
various liquids, such as Acetic Ether, Ether and Alcohol,
etc., and, what is more remarkable, it no longer burns in
the air quietly, but explodes on the application of flame
with greater or less violence.</p>

<p>This change of properties clearly shows, that although
the fibrous structure of the material is unaffected, it is
no longer the same substance, and consequently chemists
have assigned it a different name, viz. Pyroxyline.</p>

<p>To produce the peculiar change by which Cotton is converted
into Pyroxyline, both Nitric and Sulphuric Acids
are, as a rule, required; but of the two the former is the
most important. On analyzing Pyroxyline, Nitric Acid,
or a body analogous to it, is detected in considerable quantity,
but not Sulphuric Acid. The latter Acid, in fact,
serves but a temporary purpose, viz. to prevent the Nitric
Acid from dissolving the pyroxyline, which it would be
liable to do if employed alone. The Sulphuric Acid prevents
the solution by removing water from the Nitric
Acid, and so producing a higher degree of concentration;
Pyroxyline, although soluble in a dilute, is not so in the
strong Acid, and hence it is preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The property possessed by Oil of Vitriol of removing
water from other bodies, is one with which it is well to
be acquainted. A simple experiment will serve to illustrate
it. Let a small vessel of any kind be filled to about
two-thirds with Oil of Vitriol, and set aside for a few
days; at the end of that time, and especially if the atmosphere
be damp, it will have absorbed sufficient moisture
to cause it to flow over the edge.</p>

<p>Now even the strongest reagents employed in chemistry
contain, almost invariably, water in greater or lesser quantity.
Pure Anhydrous Nitric Acid is a white, solid substance;
Hydrochloric Acid is a gas: and the liquids sold
under those names are merely solutions. The effect then
of mixing strong Oil of Vitriol with aqueous Nitric Acid
is to remove water in proportion to the amount used, and
to produce a liquid containing Nitric Acid in a high state
of concentration, and Sulphuric Acid more or less diluted.
This liquid is the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid employed in the
preparation of Pyroxyline.</p>

<p>Various forms of Pyroxyline.&mdash;Very soon after the
first announcement of the discovery of Pyroxyline, most
animated discussions arose amongst chemists with regard
to its solubility and general properties. Some spoke of a
"solution of Gun-Cotton in Ether;" whilst others denied
its solubility in that menstruum; a third class, by following
the process described, obtained a substance which was
not explosive, and therefore could scarcely be termed Gun-Cotton.</p>

<p>On further investigations some of these anomalies were
cleared up, and it was found that there were varieties of
Pyroxyline, depending mainly upon the degree of strength
of the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid employed in the preparation.
Still the subject was obscure until the publication of
researches by Mr. E. A. Hadow. These investigations,
conducted in the Laboratory of King's College, London,
were published in the Journal of the Chemical Society.
Constant reference will be made to them in the following
remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>We notice&mdash;first, the chemical constitution of Pyroxyline;
secondly, its varieties; and thirdly, the means
adopted to procure a Nitro-Sulphuric Acid of the proper
strength.</p>

<p>a. <i>Constitution of Pyroxyline.</i>&mdash;Pyroxyline has been
sometimes spoken of as a Salt of Nitric Acid, a Nitrate of
Lignine. This view however is erroneous, since it can be
shown that the substance present is not Nitric Acid, although
analogous to it. It is the Peroxide of Nitrogen,
which is intermediate in composition between Nitrous Acid
(NO<sub>3</sub>) and Nitric Acid (NO<sub>5</sub>). Peroxide of Nitrogen
(NO<sub>4</sub>) is a gaseous body of a dark red colour; it possesses
no acid properties, and is incapable of forming a class of
salts. In order to understand in what state this body is
combined with cotton fibre to form Pyroxyline, it will be
necessary to digress for a short time.</p>

<p>Law of Substitution.&mdash;By the careful study of the action
of Chlorine, and of Nitric Acid, upon various organic substances,
a remarkable series of compounds has been discovered,
containing a portion of Chlorine or of Peroxide of
Nitrogen in the place of Hydrogen. The peculiarity of
these substances is, that they strongly resemble the originals
in their physical, and often in their chemical properties.
It might have been supposed that agents of such
active chemical affinities as Chlorine and Oxide of Nitrogen
would, by their mere presence in a body, produce a
marked effect; yet it is not so in the case before us. The
primitive type or constitution of the substance modified
remains the same, even the crystalline form being often
unaffected. It seems as if the body by which the Hydrogen
had been displaced had stepped in quietly and
taken up its position in the framework of the whole without
disturbance. Many compounds of this kind are known;
they are termed by chemists "substitution compounds."
The law invariably observed is, that the substitution takes
place in equal atoms: a single atom of Chlorine, for instance,
displaces one of Hydrogen; two of Chlorine displace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
two of Hydrogen, and so on, until, in some cases,
the whole of the latter element is separated.</p>

<p>In illustration of these remarks, take the following instances:&mdash;Acetic
Acid contains Carbon, Hydrogen, and
Oxygen; by the action of Chlorine the Hydrogen may be
removed in the form of Hydrochloric Acid, and an equal
number of atoms of Chlorine be substituted. In this way
a new compound is formed, termed <i>Chloracetic Acid</i>, resembling
in many important particulars the Acetic Acid
itself. Notice particularly that the peculiar properties
characteristic of Chlorine are completely masked in the
substitution body, and no indication of its presence is
obtained by the usual tests! A soluble <i>Chloride</i> gives
with Nitrate of Silver a white precipitate of Chloride of
Silver, unaffected by Acids, but the Chloracetic Acid does
not; hence it is plain that the Chlorine exists in a peculiar
and Ultimate state of combination different from what
is usual.</p>

<p>The substance we have been previously considering,
viz. Pyroxyline, affords another illustration of the Law of
Substitution. Omitting, for the sake of simplicity, the
number of atoms concerned in the change, the action of
concentrated Nitric Acid upon ligneous fibre may be thus
explained:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>By a reference to the formula, it is seen that the fifth
atom of Oxygen contained in the Nitric Acid takes one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Hydrogen, and forms an atom of Water; the NO<sub>4</sub> then
steps in, to fill the gap which the atom of Hydrogen has
left. All this is done with so little disturbance that even
the fibrous structure of the cotton remains as before.</p>

<p>b. <i>Chemical Composition of the varieties of Pyroxyline.</i>&mdash;Mr.
Hadow has succeeded in establishing <i>four</i> different
substitution compounds, which, as no distinctive nomenclature
has been at present proposed, may be termed compounds
A, B, C, and D.</p>

<p><i>Compound A</i> is the most explosive Gun-Cotton, and
contains the largest amount of Peroxide of Nitrogen. It
dissolves <i>only in Acetic Ether</i>, and is left on evaporation
as a white powder. It is produced by the strongest Nitro-Sulphuric
Acid which can be made.</p>

<p><i>Compounds B and C</i>, either separate or in a state of
mixture, form the soluble material employed by the Photographer.
They both dissolve in Acetic Ether, and also in
a mixture of Ether and Alcohol. The latter, viz. C, also
dissolves in glacial Acetic Acid. They are produced by
a Nitro-Sulphuric Acid slightly weaker than that used for
A, and contain a smaller amount of Peroxide of Nitrogen.</p>

<p><i>Compound D</i> resembles what has been termed <i>Xyloidine</i>,
that is, the substance produced by acting with Nitric Acid
upon Starch. It contains less Peroxide of Nitrogen than
the others, and dissolves in Ether and Alcohol, and also
in Acetic Acid. The ethereal solution leaves, on evaporation,
an opaque film, which is highly combustible, but not
explosive.</p>

<p>By bearing in mind the properties of these compounds,
many of the anomalies complained of in the manufacture
of Gun-Cotton disappear. If the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid
employed is too strong, the product will be insoluble in
Ether; whilst if it is too weak, the fibres are gelatinized
by the Acid and partly dissolved.</p>

<p>c. <i>Means adopted to procure a Nitro-Sulphuric Acid of
the requisite strength for preparing Pyroxyline.</i>&mdash;This is
a point of more difficulty than would at first appear. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
is easy to determine an exact formula for the mixture, but
not so easy to hit upon the proper proportions of the acids
required to produce that formula; and a very slight departure
from them altogether modifies the result. The
main difficulty lies in <i>the uncertain strength of commercial
Nitric Acid</i>. Oil of Vitriol is more to be depended upon,
and has a tolerably uniform Sp. Gr. of 1·836;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but Nitric
Acid is constantly liable to variation; hence it becomes
necessary to make a preliminary determination of its real
strength, which is done either by taking the specific gravity
and referring to tables, or, better still, by a direct analysis.
As each atom of Sulphuric Acid removes only a given
quantity of water, it follows that the weaker the Nitric
Acid, the larger the amount of Sulphuric which will be required
to bring it up to the proper degree of concentration.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The later experience of the writer induces him to believe, that the specific
gravity of Oil of Vitriol cannot always be taken as an indication of its
real strength; which is best ascertained by analysis.</p></div>

<p>To avoid the trouble necessarily attendant upon these
preliminary operations, many prefer to use, in place of
Nitric Acid itself, one of the salts formed by the combination
of Nitric Acid with an alkaline base. The composition
of these salts, provided they are pure and nicely crystallized,
can be depended on.</p>

<p>Nitrate of Potash, or <i>Saltpetre</i>, contains a single atom
of Nitric Acid united with one of Potash. It is an <i>anhydrous</i>
salt, that is, it has no water of crystallization. When
strong Sulphuric Acid is poured upon Nitrate of Potash
in a state of fine powder, in virtue of its superior chemical
affinities it appropriates to itself the Alkali and liberates
the Nitric Acid. If care be taken to add a sufficient excess
of the Sulphuric Acid, a solution is obtained containing
Sulphate of Potash dissolved in Sulphuric Acid, and
free Nitric Acid. The presence of the Sulphate of Potash
(or, more strictly speaking, of the <i>Bi</i>-Sulphate) does not
in any way interfere with the result, and the effect is the
same as if the mixed acids themselves had been used.</p>

<p class="caption4nb">CHEMISTRY OF THE SOLUTION OF PYROXYLINE IN
ETHER AND ALCOHOL, OR "COLLODION."</p>

<p>The substitution compounds B and C, already alluded to
as forming the Soluble Cotton of Photographers, are both
abundantly soluble in Acetic Ether. This liquid however
is not adapted for the purpose required, inasmuch as on
evaporation it leaves the Pyroxyline in the form of a white
powder, and not as a transparent layer.</p>

<p>The rectified Ether of commerce has been found to
answer better than any other liquid as a solvent for Pyroxyline.</p>

<p>If the sp. gravity be about ·750, it contains invariably a
small proportion of <i>Alcohol</i>, which appears to be necessary;
the solution not taking place with absolutely pure Ether.
The Pyroxyline, if properly prepared, begins almost immediately
to gelatinize by the action of the Ether, and is
soon completely dissolved. In this state it forms a slimy
solution, which, when poured out on a glass plate, dries up
into a horny transparent layer.</p>

<p>In preparing Collodion for Photographic purposes, we
find that its physical properties are liable to considerable
variation. Sometimes it appears very thin and fluid, flowing
on the glass almost like water, whilst at others it is
thick and glutinous. The causes of these differences will
now engage our attention. They may be divided into two
classes: first, those relating to the Pyroxyline; second,
to the solvents employed.</p>

<p>a. <i>Variation of Properties in different Samples of soluble
Pyroxyline.</i>&mdash;The substitution compounds A, B, C,
and D differ, as already shown, in the percentage amount
of Peroxide of Nitrogen present, and the former are more
explosive and insoluble than the latter. But it often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
happens in preparing Pyroxyline, that two portions of
Nitro-Sulphuric Acid taken from the same bottle yield
products which vary in properties, although they are necessarily
the same in composition.</p>

<p>Taking <i>extremes</i> in illustration, we notice two principal
modifications of soluble Pyroxyline.</p>

<p>The first, when treated with the mixture of Ether and
Alcohol, sinks down to a gummy or gelatinous mass, which
gradually dissolves on agitation The solution is very fluid
in proportion to the number of grains used, and when
poured out spreads into a beautifully smooth and glassy
surface, which is quite structureless, even when highly
magnified. The film adheres tightly to the glass, and when
the finger is drawn across it, separates in short fragments,
and broken pieces.</p>

<p>The second variety produces a Collodion which is thick
and glutinous, flowing over the glass in a slimy manner,
and soon setting into numerous small waves and cellular
spaces. The film lies loose upon the glass, is apt to contract
on drying, and may be pushed off by the finger in
the form of a connected skin.</p>

<p>This subject is not thoroughly understood, but it is
known that the <i>temperature</i> of the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid
at the time of immersing the Cotton influences the result.
The soluble variety is produced by <i>hot</i> acids; the second,
or glutinous, by the same acids employed cold, or only
slightly warm. The best temperature appears to be from
130° to 155° Fahrenheit; if it rises much beyond that
point, the acids act upon and dissolve the Cotton.</p>

<p>b. <i>The physical properties of Collodion affected by the
proportions and purity of the Solvents.</i>&mdash;Pyroxyline of the
varieties termed B and C dissolves freely in a mixture of
Ether and Alcohol; but the characters of the resulting
solution vary with the relative proportions of the two solvents.</p>

<p>When the Ether is in large excess, the film is inclined
to be strong and tough, so that it can often be raised by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
one corner and lifted completely off the plate without tearing.
It is also very contractile, so that a portion of the
Collodion poured on the hand draws together and puckers
the skin as it dries. If spread upon a glass plate in the
usual way, the same property of contractility causes it to
retract and separate from the sides of the glass.</p>

<p>These properties, produced by Ether in large proportion,
disappear entirely on the addition of more Alcohol. The
transparent layer is now soft and easily torn, possessing
but little coherency. It adheres to the surface of the glass
more firmly, and exhibits no tendency to contract and separate
from the sides.</p>

<p>From these remarks it will be gathered that an excess of
Ether, and a low temperature in preparing the Pyroxyline,
both favour the production of a contractile Collodion;
whilst on the other hand an abundance of Alcohol, and a
hot Nitro-Sulphuric Acid, tend to produce a short and
non-contractile Collodion.</p>

<p>The physical properties of Collodion are affected by another
cause, viz. by the <i>strength</i> and purity of the solvents,
or, in other words, their freedom from dilution with water.
If a few drops of water be purposely added to a sample of
Collodion, the effect is seen to be to precipitate the Pyroxyline
in flakes to the bottom of the bottle. There are
many substances known in chemistry which are soluble
in spirituous liquids, but behave in the same manner as
Pyroxyline in this respect.</p>

<p>The manner in which water gains entrance into the
Photographic Collodion is usually by the employment of
Alcohol or Spirit of Wine which has not been highly
rectified. In that case the Collodion is thicker, and flows
less readily than if the Alcohol were stronger. Sometimes
the texture of the film left upon evaporation is injured;
it is no longer homogeneous and transparent, but semi-opaque,
reticulated, or honeycombed, and so rotten that
a stream of water projected upon the plate washes it away.</p>

<p>These effects are to be attributed not to the Alcohol, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to the water introduced with it; and the remedy will be
to procure a stronger spirit, or, if that cannot be done, to
increase the amount of Ether. Collodion prepared with a
large proportion of Ether, and water, but a small quantity
of Alcohol, is often very fluid and structureless at first,
adhering to the glass with some tenacity and having a short
texture; but it tends to become rotten when used to coat
many plates successively, the water on account of its
lesser volatility accumulating in injurious quantity in the
last portions.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE COLORATION OF IODIZED COLLODION EXPLAINED.</p>

<p>Collodion iodized with the Iodides of Potassium, Ammonium,
or Zinc, soon assumes a yellow tint, which in the
course of a few days or weeks, according to the temperature
of the atmosphere, deepens to a full brown. This gradual
coloration, due to a development of Iodine, is caused
partly by the Ether and partly by the Pyroxyline.</p>

<p>Ether may, with proper precautions, be preserved for a
long time in a pure state, but on exposure to the joint
action of air and light it undergoes a slow process of oxidation,
attended with formation of Acetic Acid and a peculiar
principle resembling in properties ozone, or Oxygen
in an allotropic and active condition. Iodide of Potassium
or Ammonium is decomposed by Ether in this state. Acetate
of the Alkali, and Hydriodic Acid (HI), being first
produced. The ozonized substance then removes Hydrogen
from the latter compound, and liberates Iodine, which dissolves
and tinges the liquid yellow.</p>

<p>A simple solution of an Alkaline Iodide in Alcohol and
Ether does not, however, become so quickly coloured as
Iodized Collodion; and hence it is evident that the presence
of the Pyroxyline produces an effect. It may be
shown that Alkaline Iodides slowly decompose Pyroxyline,
and that a portion of Peroxide of Nitrogen is set free:
this body, containing loosely combined oxygen, tends
powerfully to eliminate Iodine, as may be seen by adding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a few drops of the yellow commercial Nitrous acid to a
solution of Iodide of Potassium.</p>

<p>The <i>stability</i> of the particular Iodide used in Iodizing
Collodion, influences mainly the rate of coloration, though
elevation of temperature and exposure to light are not
without effect. Iodide of Ammonium is the least stable,
and Iodide of Cadmium the most so; Iodide of Potassium
being intermediate. Collodion iodized with <i>pure</i> Iodide
of Cadmium usually remains nearly colourless to the last
drop, if kept in a cool and dark place.</p>

<p>As the presence of free Iodine in Collodion affects its
photographic properties, it may sometimes be necessary to
remove it. This is done by inserting a strip of Silver-foil;
which decolorizes the liquid, by forming Iodide of Silver,
soluble in the excess of Alkaline Iodide (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>). Metallic
Cadmium, and metallic Zinc, have the same effect.</p>

<p>When Methylated Spirits are employed in the manufacture
of Collodion, the Iodine first liberated is afterwards
either partially or entirely reabsorbed, the liquid acquiring
at the same time an acid reaction to test-paper.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Chemistry of the Nitrate Bath.</i></p>

<p>The solution of Nitrate of Silver in which the plate
coated with iodized Collodion is dipped, to form the layer
of Iodide of Silver, is known technically as <i>the Nitrate
Bath</i>. The chemistry of Nitrate of Silver has been explained
at <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>, but there are some points relating to
the properties of its aqueous solution which require a further
notice.</p>

<p><i>Solubility of Iodide of Silver in the Nitrate Bath.</i>&mdash;Aqueous
solution of Nitrate of Silver may be mentioned
in the list of solvents of Iodide of Silver. The proportion
dissolved is in all cases small, but it increases with the
<i>strength</i> of the solution. If no attention were paid to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
point, and the precaution of previously saturating the Nitrate
Bath with Iodide of Silver neglected, the film would
be dissolved when left too long in the liquid.</p>

<p>This solvent power of Nitrate of Silver on the Iodide is
well shown by taking the excited Collodion plate out of the
Bath, and allowing it to dry spontaneously. The layer of
Nitrate on the surface, becoming concentrated by evaporation,
eats away the film, so as to produce a transparent,
spotted appearance.</p>

<p>In the solution of Iodide of Silver by Nitrate of Silver
a <i>double salt</i> is formed, which corresponds in properties to
the double Iodide of Potassium and Silver in being <i>decomposed</i>
by the addition of water. Consequently, in order
to saturate a Bath with Iodide of Silver it is only necessary
to dissolve the total weight of Nitrate of Silver in a
small bulk of water, and to add to it a few grains of an
Iodide; perfect solution takes place, and on subsequent
dilution with the full amount of water, the excess of Iodide
of Silver is precipitated in the form of a milky deposit.</p>

<p><i>Acid condition of Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;A solution of <i>pure
Nitrate of Silver</i> is neutral to blue litmus-paper, but that
prepared from the commercial Nitrate has usually an acid
reaction; the crystals having been imperfectly drained
from the acid mother-liquor in which they were formed.
Hence, in making a new Bath it is often advisable not
only to saturate it with Iodide of Silver, but to neutralize
the free Nitric acid it contains.</p>

<p>There is also a peculiar condition of Nitrate of Silver
crystallized from a solution of the metal in Nitric Acid,
which renders it quite unfit for photographic purposes
(see <a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>). It is thought to depend upon the presence
of an oxide of Nitrogen, possibly of Nitrous Acid, and the
remedy is to dry the crystals very strongly, or, better
still, to fuse them at a moderate heat: mere neutralization
with Carbonate of Soda does not suffice.</p>

<p>In melting Nitrate of Silver great care should be taken
not to raise the heat so high as to decompose the salt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
or a basic Nitrite will be formed, which affects the properties
of the solution (<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>): fused Nitrate of Silver
ought, when cold, to be quite white, and to dissolve perfectly
in water without leaving any residue. The only objection
to the employment of Nitrate of Silver in this form
is the facility with which it may be adulterated with Nitrates
of Potash and Soda, the presence of which would
lessen the available strength of the Bath.</p>

<p>The Nitrate Bath, although perfectly neutral when first
prepared, may become <i>acid</i> by continued use, if Collodion
containing much <i>free Iodine</i> be constantly employed. In
that case a portion of Nitric Acid is liberated, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">

  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdl">Iodide of Silver</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitric Acid + Oxygen.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When Collodion is iodized entirely with alkaline Iodides,
it liberates Iodine by keeping; and hence the occasional
use of Ammonia may be required to remove acidity from
the Bath. But since the introduction of the Iodide of
Cadmium, which preserves the Collodion nearly or quite
colourless, the necessity for neutralizing Nitric Acid in the
Bath has ceased.</p>

<p><i>Alkaline condition of the Bath.</i>&mdash;By "alkalinity" of the
Bath is meant a condition in which the blue tint is rapidly
restored to reddened litmus-paper. This indicates that an
Oxide of some kind is present in solution, which, by combining
with the acid in the reddened paper, neutralizes it
and removes the red colour.</p>

<p>If a small portion of caustic Potash or Ammonia be
added to a strong solution of Nitrate of Silver, it produces
a brown precipitate, which is Oxide of Silver.</p>

<table summary="data">

  <td class="tdl">Oxide of Silver</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate Ammonia.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The solution however, from which the precipitate has
separated, is not left in a neutral state, but possesses a
faint alkaline reaction. Oxide of Silver and Carbonate of
Silver are also <i>abundantly</i> soluble in water containing Nitrate
of Ammonia; which salt is continually accumulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
in the Bath when compounds of Ammonium are used for
iodizing.</p>

<p>An alkaline Bath is perhaps of all conditions the one
most fatal to success in photography. It leads to that
universal darkening of the film on applying the developer
to which the name of "fogging" has been given. Hence
care must be used in adding to the Bath substances which
tend to make it alkaline.</p>

<p>Collodion containing free Ammonia, often sold in the
shops, gradually does so. The use of Potash, Carbonate
of Soda, Chalk, or Marble, to remove free Nitric Acid from
the Bath, has the same effect; and hence, when they are
employed, a trace of Acetic acid must afterwards be added.</p>

<p>The mode of testing a bath for alkalinity is as follows:&mdash;
a strip of porous blue litmus-paper is taken and held to
the mouth of a bottle of glacial Acetic acid until it becomes
reddened; it is then placed in the liquid to be examined
and left for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. If Oxide
of Silver be present in solution, the original blue colour of
the paper will slowly but gradually be restored.</p>

<p><i>Occasional formation of Acetate of Silver in the Nitrate
Bath.</i>&mdash;In preparing a new Bath, if the crystals of Nitrate
of Silver are acid, it is usual to add an alkali in small
quantity. This removes the Nitric Acid, but leaves the
solution faintly alkaline. Acetic Acid is then dropped in,
which, by combining with the Oxide of Silver, forms
Acetate of Silver.</p>

<p>Acetate of Silver is not formed by the simple addition of
Acetic Acid to the Bath, because its production under such
circumstances would imply the liberation of Nitric Acid;
but if an alkali be present to neutralize the Nitric Acid,
then the double decomposition takes place, thus&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdl">Acetate of Ammonia</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of Silver</td>

<tr>
  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdl">Acetate of Silver</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of Ammonia.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Acetate of Silver is a white flaky salt, sparingly soluble
in water. It dissolves in the Bath only in small
proportion, but yet sufficiently to affect the Photographic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
properties of the film (see p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a> and <a href="#Page_117">117</a>). The observance
of the following simple rules will obviate its production in
injurious quantity:&mdash;<i>First</i>, when it is required to remove
free Nitric Acid from a bath <i>not containing Acetic Acid</i> a
solution of Potash or Carbonate of Soda may be dropped
in <i>freely</i>; but the liquid must be filtered before adding
any Acetic Acid, otherwise the brown deposit of Oxide of
Silver will be taken up by the Acetic Acid, and the Bath
will be charged with Acetate of Silver. <i>Secondly</i>, in dealing
with a Bath containing both Nitric and Acetic Acids,
employ an alkali <i>much diluted</i> (Liquor Ammoniæ with 10
parts of Water), and add a single drop at a time, coating
and trying a plate between each addition; the Nitric
Acid will neutralize itself before the Acetic, and with care
there will be no formation of Acetate of Silver in quantity.</p>

<p><i>Substances which decompose the Nitrate Bath.</i>&mdash;Most of
the common metals, having superior affinity for Oxygen,
separate the Silver from a solution of the Nitrate; hence
the Bath must be kept in glass, porcelain, or gutta-percha,
and contact with Iron, Copper, Mercury, etc., must be
avoided, or the liquid will be discoloured, and a black deposit
of metallic Silver precipitated.</p>

<p>All developing agents, such as Gallic and Pyrogallic
Acids, the Protosalts of Iron, etc., blacken the Nitrate
Bath, and render it useless by reducing metallic Silver.</p>

<p>Chlorides, Iodides, and Bromides produce a deposit in
the Bath; but the solution, although weakened, may again
be used after passing through a filter.</p>

<p>Hyposulphites, Cyanides, and all fixing agents decompose
Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p>Organic matters, generally, reduce Nitrate of Silver,
either with or without the aid of light. Grape Sugar,
Albumen, Serum of Milk containing caseine, etc., blacken
the Bath, even in the dark. Alcohol and Ether act more
slowly, and produce no injurious effect unless the liquid is
constantly exposed to light.</p>

<p>These facts indicate that the Nitrate Bath containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
volatile organic matters must be preserved in a dark
place; also that it should be kept exclusively for sensitizing
the Collodion plates, and not used in floating papers
intended for the printing process.</p>

<p><i>Changes in the Nitrate Bath by use.</i>&mdash;The solution of
Nitrate of Silver employed in exciting the Collodion film
gradually decreases in strength, but not so quickly as the
Bath used in sensitizing papers for printing. If the amount
of Nitrate be allowed to fall as low as twenty grains to
the ounce of water, the decomposition will be imperfect,
and the film will be pale and blue, even with a highly
iodized Collodion.</p>

<p>A gradual accumulation of Ether and Alcohol also takes
place in the Bath after long use, in consequence of which
the developing solutions flow less readily upon the Collodionized
plates, and oily stains are apt to be produced.</p>

<p>Diminished sensitiveness of the Iodide film is sometimes
traced to impurities in the Bath, when it is very old, and
has been much used. These are probably of an organic
nature and may often be partially removed by agitation
with kaolin, or animal charcoal. The latter however is
objectionable, being usually contaminated with <i>Carbonate
of Lime</i>, which makes the Bath alkaline; or (in the case
of <i>purified</i> animal charcoal) with traces of Hydrochloric
Acid, which liberate Nitric Acid in the Bath. Even the
kaolin may as a preliminary precaution be washed with
dilute Acetic Acid to remove Carbonate of Lime if any
should be present.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION III.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Conditions which affect the Formation and Development
of the Latent Image in the Collodion process.</i></p>

<p>It will be necessary to preface the observations contained
in this Section by defining two terms which are frequently
confounded with each other, but are in reality of distinct
meaning. These terms are "Sensitiveness" and "Intensity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>By Sensitiveness is meant a facility of receiving impression
from very feeble rays of light, or of receiving it quickly
from brighter rays.</p>

<p>Intensity, on the other hand, relates to the appearance
of the finished Photograph, independently of the time
taken to produce it,&mdash;<i>to the degree of opacity of the image</i>,
and the extent to which it obstructs transmitted light.</p>

<p>It will be seen as we proceed that the conditions necessary
to obtain extreme sensitiveness of the Iodide film are
different from, and often opposed to, those which give the
maximum intensity of image.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">CAUSES WHICH INFLUENCE THE SENSITIVENESS OF IODIDE
OF SILVER ON COLLODION.</p>

<p>Some of the most important are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>a. <i>The presence of free Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;When the
sensitive film is removed from the Nitrate Bath, the Iodide
of Silver is left in contact with excess of Nitrate of Silver.
The presence of this compound is not <i>essential</i> to the action
of the light, since, if it be removed by washing in
distilled water, the image may still be impressed. In such
a case however the effect is produced slowly, and a longer
exposure in the Camera is required.</p>

<p>The sensitiveness of the Iodide film does not increase
uniformly with the amount of the excess of Nitrate of
Silver, as measured by the strength of the Bath. It is
found that no advantage in this respect can be gained by
using a proportion of Nitrate of Silver greater than 30
or 35 grains to the ounce of water, although solutions of
three times this strength have been sometimes employed.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that a chemically pure Iodide of
Silver, which is unaffected in colour by the direct action
of light, is also incapable of receiving the invisible image
in the Camera; and that the sensitiveness of a washed
Collodion film is due to a minute quantity of Nitrate of
Silver still remaining. Iodide of Silver in the state in
which it is thrown down on diluting with water a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
solution of the salt known as the double Iodide of Potassium
and Silver,&mdash;and which must, from the mode of
its preparation, be free from Nitrate of Silver,&mdash;is quite
insensitive; but this form of Iodide differs from the other
in colour, and not only so, but is likely to contain an excess
of Iodide of Potassium. The application of a solution
of Nitrate of Silver to this compound at once renders it
sensitive to light.</p>

<p>b. <i>Free acids in the Nitrate Bath.</i>&mdash;Strong oxidizing
agents, such as Nitric Acid, greatly diminish the sensibility
of the film, and hence the importance of removing
the free acid often met with in commercial samples of the
Nitrate of Silver. The effect of even a single drop of
strong Nitric Acid in an eight-ounce Nitrate Bath will be
appreciable; and when the proportion is increased to one
drop per ounce, it will be difficult to obtain a rapid impression.</p>

<p>Acetic Acid has far less effect upon the sensitiveness
than Nitric Acid, and being found useful during the development
of the image is commonly employed; but when
great rapidity is desired, it should be added cautiously,
and in a proportion very much less than that in the solution
known as the Aceto-Nitrate of Silver, which contains
about one drop of the glacial acid to each grain of Nitrate
of Silver.</p>

<p>c. <i>Addition of certain organic matters.</i>&mdash;It has long
been remarked that the use of bodies like Albumen, Gelatine,
Caseine, etc., which combine with Oxides of Silver,
retard the action of light upon Iodide of Silver; and the
recent observations of the Author enable him to confirm
this statement. It is probable that one cause, amongst
others, of the great sensibility of the Collodion film is due
to the fact that Pyroxyline is a substance peculiarly indifferent
to the Salts of Silver, exhibiting no tendency to
reduce them to the metallic state; and it is proved by experiment
that the addition of Grape Sugar, or of the resinous
body, Glycyrrhizine, which resembles Albumen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
causing a white precipitate in strong solution of Nitrate
of Silver, renders necessary a longer exposure in the Camera.
Alkaline Citrates have a still more marked effect,
as also have Tartrates, Oxalates, etc.</p>

<p>d. <i>Impurities in the soluble Iodides.</i>&mdash;Commercial Iodide
of Potassium often contains <i>Iodate</i> of Potash, which is
found to have a retarding effect upon the action of light;
also Carbonate of Potash, which, in Collodion, produces
Iodoform,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and in the paper processes, where "Aceto-Nitrate"
is used for sensitizing, forms Acetate of Silver.
Iodoform has a marked influence in diminishing the sensitiveness
of Iodide of Silver; Acetate of Silver may perhaps
increase it a little by securing the absence of free
Nitric Acid (<a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>). Iodide of Potassium prepared by
the process in which Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Alcohol
are used, and having a smell of Garlic, contains probably
Xanthate of Potash, and is nearly useless for Photography.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> See the Vocabulary, Part III., Art. Iodoform.</p></div>

<p>Commercial Iodide of Cadmium is a purer salt than the
Iodide of Potassium, and may be advantageously substituted
for it; but it possesses the property of coagulating
Albumen, and hence cannot be employed in conjunction
with that substance.</p>

<p>e. <i>Presence of free Iodine.</i>&mdash;Both in the waxed paper
and the Collodion processes, the solutions often contain a
small quantity of free Iodine. This Iodine, in contact
with the Nitrate of Silver of the Bath, produces a mixed
Iodide and <i>Iodate</i> of Silver, and liberates Nitric Acid. It
thus retards the sensitiveness of the film in proportion to
the quantity of Iodine present. Collodion of a full yellow
colour is perceptibly less sensitive than the same rendered
colourless; and when enough Iodine has been liberated
to give a red or brown tint, double the original exposure
will probably be required.</p>

<p>If brown Collodion be much used, the Nitrate Bath
may by degrees become sufficiently contaminated with free
Nitric Acid to interfere with the sensitiveness of the film;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
but if colourless or lemon-yellow tinted Collodion be employed,
this evil need not be anticipated.</p>

<p>Certain substances may be added to coloured Collodion
which possess the property of counteracting the retarding
influence of the free Iodine, such, for instance, as the Oils
of Cloves, Cinnamon, etc.; they probably act in virtue of
their affinity for Oxygen, by preventing the formation of
Iodate of Silver. In colourless Collodion they produce
little or no effect, neither do they remove the insensitiveness
of the film when dependent upon a too acid condition
of the Nitrate Bath.</p>

<p>f. <i>Addition of Bromide or Chloride to Collodion.</i>&mdash;In
the Daguerreotype a very exalted state of sensibility is
obtained by exposing the silvered plate first to the vapour
of Iodine, and afterwards to that of Bromine or Chlorine;
but this rule does not apply to the Collodion process,
which differs essentially in principle. Soluble Bromides
added to Collodion lessen its sensibility to an appreciable
extent, as also do Chlorides. This rule however may
perhaps be liable to an exception when artificial light is
used, which contains a greater proportion of the rays of
small refrangibility, known to act more powerfully upon
the Bromide than upon the Iodide of Silver (<a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>).</p>

<p>g. <i>Density of the sensitive film.</i>&mdash;When the proportion
of soluble Iodide in the iodizing solution is too great, the
film is very dense, and the Iodide of Silver is apt to burst
out upon the surface, and fall away in loose flakes into the
Bath. This condition, which is highly unfavourable to
sensitiveness, is very common in Collodion, and constitutes
what is termed "over-iodizing." The Iodide, in fact, is
formed in such a case too much upon the surface, and consequently,
when the fixing agent is applied, the image not
being retained by the film, is washed off and lost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the sensibility of the film is not
lessened by reducing the amount of Iodide in Collodion to
a minimum, if all the solutions are neutral; but the pale
blue films formed by a dilute Collodion, and which almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rival the Daguerreotype itself in delicacy, are nearly useless
in practice; for if free Iodine or other bodies of a retarding
nature are present in any quantity, either in the
Collodion or in the Bath, they almost destroy the action
of a weak light, producing a far more injurious effect than
if the film were more yellow and opaque.</p>

<p>h. <i>Impurities in Ether and Alcohol.</i>&mdash;Pure Ether should
be neutral to test-paper, but the commercial samples of
this article have usually either an acid or an alkaline reaction.
The frequent occurrence of a peculiar oxidizing
principle in Ether has also been pointed out (<a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>). Each
of these three conditions is injurious to sensitiveness; the
first and last by liberating Iodine when alkaline Iodides
are used; and the second, by producing Iodoform under
the same circumstances. In this case the Collodion remains
colourless, but gives inferior results.</p>

<p>The Author has also observed that Ether which has
been redistilled from the residues of Collodion may contain
a volatile principle (probably a compound Ether?)
which produces a retarding effect upon the action of light.</p>

<p>Commercial Spirit of Wine is not always uniform in
composition, as sufficiently evidenced by the test of smell.
It may contain "fusel oil" or other volatile substances,
which become milky on dilution with water, and are believed
to injure the quality of the spirit for Photographic
use.</p>

<p>i. <i>Relative proportions of Ether and Alcohol in Collodion.</i>&mdash;It
was shown at <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a> that the addition of Alcohol
to Collodion lessens the contractility of the film, and
renders it soft and gelatinous. This condition is favourable
to the formation of the invisible image in the Camera,
the play of affinities being promoted by the loose manner
in which the particles of Iodide are held together. It is
therefore usual to add to Collodion as much Alcohol as
it will bear without becoming glutinous, or leaving the
glass; the exact quantity required varying with the strength
of the spirit or its freedom from dilution with water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>k. <i>Decomposition in the Collodion.</i>&mdash;Collodion iodized
with the metallic Iodides generally, excepting the Iodide
of Cadmium, becomes brown and loses sensitiveness in the
course of a few days or weeks. If the free Iodine, the
cause of the brown colour, be removed, the greater part,
but not the whole, of the sensitiveness is regained. The
experiments of the Author, and of others, have proved
that a solution of Pyroxyline in contact with an unstable
iodide, slowly undergoes decomposition, the result of which
is that Iodine is set free, and an equivalent quantity of the
base remains in union with certain organic elements of the
Collodion.</p>

<p>Decomposition also gradually ensues when iodized Collodion
is placed in contact with reducing agents, such as
Proto-iodide of Iron, Gallic Acid, Grape Sugar, Glycyrrhizine,
etc., so that these combinations do not retain a
constant sensibility for any length of time. Even plain
Collodion uniodized cannot be preserved many months
without a small but perceptible amount of change.</p>

<p>l. <i>Decomposition in the Nitrate Bath.</i>&mdash;A Collodion
Nitrate Bath which has been much used, often gives a less
sensitive film than when newly made. It is known also
that many organic substances which reduce Nitrate of
Silver, if added to the Bath, produce a state which is
favourable to sensitiveness whilst the decomposition is
taking place, but is eventually unfavourable; hence the
solution will be injured by adding either Gallic or Pyrogallic
Acid, and by organic matters generally if exposed
to light.</p>

<p><i>Recapitulation.</i>&mdash;The conditions most favourable to extreme
sensitiveness of the Iodide of Silver on Collodion
may be condensed as follows:&mdash;perfect neutrality of the
solutions employed; a soft, gelatinous state of the film;
absence of Chlorides and other salts which precipitate Nitrate
of Silver; an undecomposed Collodion, containing no
organic matter of that kind which is precipitated by basic
Acetate of Lead, and combines with oxides of Silver.</p>

<p class="caption4nb">THE CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE LATENT IMAGE.</p>

<p>The general theory of the development of a latent image
by means of a reducing agent, having been simply explained
in the third Chapter, may now be more fully
examined in its application to the Iodide of Silver on Collodion.</p>

<p>a. <i>The presence of free Nitrate of Silver essential to the
development.</i>&mdash;This subject has already been mentioned
(<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>). A sensitive Collodion plate, carefully washed in
distilled water, is still capable of receiving the radiant impression
in the Camera, but it does not admit of development
until it has been redipped in the Bath, or treated
with a reducing agent to which Nitrate of Silver has been
added: and if the proportion of free Nitrate of Silver on
a Collodion film be too small, the image will be feeble
or altogether imperfect in parts, with patches of green or
blue, due to deficient reduction.</p>

<p>b. <i>Comparative strength of deducing Agents.</i>&mdash;No increase
of power in a developer will suffice to bring out a
perfect image on an under-exposed plate, or upon a film
containing too little Nitrate of Silver. But there is considerable
difference in the length of time which the
various developers require to act. Gallic Acid is the most
feeble, and Pyrogallic Acid the strongest, producing at
least four times more effect than an equal weight of the
crystallized Protosulphate of Iron, and twenty times more
than the Protonitrate of Iron.</p>

<p>c. <i>The effect of free Acid upon the development.</i>&mdash;Acids
tend to retard the reduction of the image as well as to
diminish the sensibility of the film to light. Nitric Acid
especially does so, from its powerful oxidizing and solvent
properties. The effect of Nitric Acid is particularly seen
when the film of Iodide of Silver is very blue and transparent,
and the quantity of Nitrate of Silver retained
upon its surface small. Under such circumstances the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
proper development of the image may be suspended, and
spangles of metallic Silver separate. This indicates that
the quantity of the acid should be diminished, or the
strength of the Nitrate Bath and of the reducing agent be
increased, as a counterpoise to the retarding action of acid
upon the development.</p>

<p>Acetic Acid also moderates the rapidity of development,
but it has not that tendency altogether to suspend it possessed
by Nitric Acid. It is therefore usefully employed,
to enable the operator to cover the plate evenly with
liquid before the development commences, and to preserve
the white parts of the impression from any accidental deposit
of metallic Silver due to irregular action of the reducing
agent.</p>

<p>On comparing the retarding effects of free acid upon the
light's action, and upon the development, we see that the
former is the most marked,&mdash;that a small quantity of Nitric
Acid produces a more decided influence upon the impression
of the image in the Camera than upon the bringing
out of that image by means of a developer.</p>

<p>d. <i>Accelerating effect of certain organic matters.</i>&mdash;Organic
bodies, like Albumen, Gelatine, Glycyrrhizine, etc.,
which combine chemically with oxides of Silver, and were
shown in the last Section to lessen the sensitiveness of the
Iodide film,&mdash;facilitate the development of the image, producing
often a dense deposit of a brown or black colour
by transmitted light.</p>

<p>In the same way, viz. by a retention of organic matter,
may partly be explained the fact, that the image developed
by Pyrogallic Acid, although proved by the application
of tests to contain no more than an equal quantity
of Silver, possesses greater opacity by transmitted light,
than that resulting from the use of protosalts of Iron: and
in the case of the Collodion itself the same rule applied&mdash;if
it be pure, it is liable to give a less vigorous impression
than when by long keeping a partial decomposition has
taken place, and products have been formed which combine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with reduced Oxide of Silver more easily than the
unaltered Pyroxyline.</p>

<p>e. <i>Molecular conditions affecting Intensity.</i>&mdash;The physical
structure of the Collodion film is thought to exert an
influence upon the mode in which the reduced Silver is
thrown down during the development. A short and almost
powdery state, such as Collodion iodized with the alkaline
iodides acquires by keeping, is considered favourable, and
a glutinous, coherent structure unfavourable, to density.
This is certainly the case when the film is allowed to dry
before development, as in the process with desiccated
Collodion and, to some extent, in the Oxymel preservative
process.</p>

<p>The mode of conducting the development also affects
the density; a rapid action tending to produce an image
of which the particles are finely divided and offer a considerable
resistance to the passage of light, whilst a slow and
prolonged development often leaves a metallic and almost
crystalline deposit, comparatively translucent and feeble.</p>

<p>The writer has observed, that with certain samples of
Collodion the image is much enfeebled by keeping the
plate for a considerable time,&mdash;a quarter of an hour or
longer,&mdash;after sensitizing, but before development. This
effect is not the result of the Nitrate of Silver having partially
drained away, since a second dip in the Nitrate
Bath immediately before applying the Pyrogallic Acid,
does not remedy it. An alteration of molecular structure
may therefore be the correct explanation, and if so, a contractile
Collodion would suffer more than one possessing
less coherency.</p>

<p>The actinic power of the light at the time of taking the
picture, influences the appearance of the developed image;
the most vigorous impressions being produced by a strong
light acting for a short time. On a dull dark day, or in
copying badly lighted interiors, the photograph will often
lack bloom and richness, and be blue and inky by transmitted
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>f. <i>Development of images upon Bromide and Chloride of
Silver.</i>&mdash;Of the three principal Salts of Silver, the Iodide
is the most sensitive to light, but the Bromide and Chloride,
under some conditions, are more easily developed and give
a darker image. In the Collodion process the difference
is principally seen when organic bodies, like Grape Sugar,
Glycyrrhizine, etc., are introduced in order to increase the
intensity; a far more decided effect being produced by
adding both Glycyrrhizine and a portion of Bromide or
Chloride, than by using the Glycyrrhizine alone.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> See the Author's Paper on the chemical composition of the photographic
image, in the eighth Chapter.</p></div>

<p>g. <i>The intensity of the image affected by the length of
exposure.</i>&mdash;This point has been briefly alluded to in the
third Chapter. If the exposure in the Camera be prolonged
beyond the proper time the development takes place rapidly
but without any intensity, the picture being pale
and translucent. The effects produced by over-action of
the light are particularly seen when the Nitrate Bath contains
Nitrite of Silver, or Acetate of Silver; the image
being frequently in such a case dark by reflected light, and
red by transmitted light,&mdash;more nearly resembling in fact
a photographic print, developed on paper prepared with
Chloride of Silver. When Collodion plates are coated
with honey without previously removing the free Nitrate
of Silver, a slow reducing action is set up, which may give
rise to the characteristic appearance above referred to, after
development. Other organic substances, such as biliary
matter, etc., will act in the same way.</p>

<p>h. <i>Certain conditions of the Bath which affect development.</i>&mdash;Attention
may be called to a peculiar state of the
Nitrate Bath, in which the Collodion image developes unusually
slowly, and has a dull grey metallic appearance,
with an absence of intensity in the parts most acted on by
the light. This condition, which occurs only when using a
newly mixed solution, is thought by the Author to depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
upon the presence of an Oxide of Nitrogen retained by
the Nitrate of Silver. It is removed partially by neutralizing
the Bath with an alkali, more perfectly so by adding
an excess of alkali followed by Acetic Acid; but most
completely by carefully <i>fusing</i> the Nitrate of Silver before
dissolving it.</p>

<p>Commercial Nitrate of Silver has sometimes a fragrant
smell, similar to that produced by pouring strong Nitric
Acid upon Alcohol. When such is the case, it contains
organic matter, and produces a Bath which yields red and
misty pictures.</p>

<p>Nitrate of Silver which has been sufficiently strongly
fused to decompose the Salt, and produce a portion of the
basic Nitrite of Silver exhibits great peculiarity of development,
the image coming out instantaneously and with great
force. This condition is exactly the reverse of that produced
by the presence of acids, in which the development
is slow and gradual.</p>

<p>In summing up the different conditions of the Nitrate
Bath which affect the development of the image, as many
as <i>four</i> might be mentioned, each of which gives a more
rapid reduction than the one which precedes it. These
are&mdash;the acid Nitrate Bath, the neutral Bath, the Bath
of strongly fused Nitrate of Silver, and the Bath containing
<i>Ammoniacal</i> Nitrate of Silver, which is quite unmanageable,
and produces an instantaneous and universal
blackening of the film on the application of the developer.</p>

<p>Greater intensity of image is commonly obtained in a
Nitrate Bath which has been a long time in use, than in a
newly mixed solution: this may be due to minute quantities
of organic matter dissolved out of the Collodion film,
which, having an affinity for Oxygen, partially reduce the
Nitrate of Silver; and also to the accumulation of Alcohol
and Ether in an old Bath producing a short and friable
structure of the film.</p>

<p>i. <i>Effect of Temperature on Development.</i>&mdash;Reduction of
the oxides of noble metals proceeds more rapidly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
proportion as the temperature rises. In cold weather it will
be found that the development of the image is slower than
usual, and that greater strength of the reducing agent
and more free Nitrate of Silver is required to produce the
effect.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the heat of the atmosphere be excessive,
the tendency to rapid reduction will be greatly
increased, the solutions decomposing each other almost
immediately on mixing. In this case the remedy will
be to use Acetic Acid <i>freely</i> both in the Bath and in the
developer, at the same time lessening the quantity of Pyrogallic
Acid, and omitting the Nitrate of Silver which is
sometimes added towards the end of the development.</p>

<p>Also in the case of films which are to be kept for a long
time in a sensitive condition by means of honey, etc., the
modifying influence of temperature must be observed, and
the quantity of free Nitrate of Silver left upon the film be
reduced to a minimum if the thermometer stands higher
than usual.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION IV.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On certain Irregularities in the Developing Process.</i></p>

<p>The characteristics of the proper development of a latent
image are&mdash;that the action of the reducing agent
should cause a blackening of the Iodide in the parts touched
by light, but produce no effect upon those which have remained
in shadow.</p>

<p>In operating both on Collodion and paper however there
is a liability to failure in this respect; the film beginning,
after the application of the developer, to change in colour
to a greater or less extent over the whole surface.</p>

<p>There are two main causes which produce this state of
things:&mdash;the first being due to an irregularity in the action
of the light; the second to a faulty condition of the chemicals
employed.</p>

<p>If from a defect in the construction of the instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
or from other causes which will be pointed out more particularly
in the Second Part of this work, diffused white
light gains entrance into the Camera, it produces indistinctness
of the image by affecting the Iodide more or less universally.</p>

<p>The luminous image of the Camera not being perfectly
pure, mere <i>over-exposure</i> of the sensitive plate will usually
have the same effect. In such a case, when the developer
is poured on, a faint image first appears, and is followed by
a general cloudiness.</p>

<p>The clearness of the developed Collodion picture is much
influenced by the condition of all the solutions employed,
but particularly so by that of the Nitrate Bath. If this
liquid be in the state termed alkaline (<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>), it will be impossible
to obtain a good picture; and even when neutral,
care and avoidance of all disturbing causes will be required
to prevent a deposition of Silver upon the shadows
of the image: especially so when Nitrite of Silver or Acetate
of Silver are present, both of these salts being more
easily reduced than the Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p>The use of <i>Acid</i> is the principal resource in obviating
cloudiness of the image. Acids lessen the facility of reduction
of the Salts of Silver by developing agents (<a href="#Page_98">p. 98</a>), and
hence when they are present the metal is deposited more
slowly, and only on the parts where the action of the light
has so modified the particles of Iodide as to favour the
decomposition: whereas if acids be absent or present in
insufficient quantity, the equilibrium of the mixture of
Nitrate of Silver and reducing agent which constitutes
the developer is so unstable, that any rough point or sharp
edge is likely to become a centre from which the chemical
action, once started, radiates to all parts of the plate.</p>

<p>Various acids have been employed, such as Acetic acid,
Citric acid, Tartaric acid, etc. Nitric acid is the most
effectual of all, but is seldom used, because, although the
image can often be developed with great clearness when
the Bath contains a small quantity of Nitric acid, yet such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a condition is not favourable to <i>intensity</i>; on the other
hand, films which are prone to irregular reduction, such as
those prepared in a chemically neutral bath or a bath containing
Acetate or Nitrite of Silver, are likely to give the
greatest vigour of impression. Hence, when this quality
is desired, the use of Nitric Acid will be adopted cautiously.</p>

<p>The state of the Collodion must be attended to as well
as that of the bath; it should be either acid or neutral,
not alkaline. Colourless Collodion may be used successfully
as a rule, but sometimes a little free Iodine is advantageously
added. Care should be taken in introducing
organic substances, many of which dissolve out into the
bath, and spoil it for giving clear pictures. Glycyrrhizine,
however, which is recommended to produce intensity of
Negatives, has no effect of that kind, and may be employed
with safety.</p>

<p>The condition of the developing agent is a point of importance
in producing clear and distinct pictures. The
Acetic acid, which is advised in the formulæ, cannot be
omitted or even lessened in quantity without danger.
This is particularly the case in hot weather or under any
other condition which favours reduction, such as neutrality
of the bath, etc.; at all times, in fact, when the solutions
of Pyrogallic acid and Nitrate of Silver decompose each
other with unusual rapidity.</p>

<p>In addition to the points now mentioned, viz. the state
of the Bath, of the Collodion, and of the developer, the
reader should also study the remarks made in the Third
Section of Chapter III. on the effect of <i>surface conditions</i>
in modifying the deposition of vapour and of metallic
Silver: he will then in all probability experience but
little difficulty in dealing with those numerous irregularities
in the action of the developing fluid, which often prove
the greatest hindrance to the successful practice of the
Collodion process.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ON POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COLLODION PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> terms "Positive" and "Negative" occur so frequently
in all works upon the subject of Photography, that it will
be impossible for the student to make progress without
thoroughly understanding their meaning.</p>

<p>A Positive may be defined to be a Photograph which
gives a natural representation of an object, as it appears to
the eye.</p>

<p>A Negative Photograph, on the other hand, has the
lights and shadows reversed, so that the appearance of the
object is changed or negatived.</p>

<p>In Photographs taken upon <i>Chloride of Silver</i>, either in
the Camera or by superposition, the effect must necessarily
be Negative; the Chloride being <i>darkened by luminous
rays</i>, the lights are represented by shadows.</p>

<p>The following simple diagrams will make this obvious.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/pg106.png" width="429" height="139" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 1.<span style="padding: 0 8em;">Fig. 2.</span>Fig. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1 is an opaque image drawn upon a transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
ground; fig. 2 represents the effect produced by placing it
in contact with a layer of sensitive Chloride and exposing
to light; and fig. 3 is the result of copying this negative
again on Chloride of Silver.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 therefore is a Positive copy of Fig. 1, obtained by
means of a Negative. By the first operation the tints are
reversed; by the second, being reversed again, they are
made to correspond to the original. The possession of a
Negative therefore enables us to obtain Positive copies of
the object, indefinite in number and all precisely similar in
appearance. This capability of multiplying impressions is
of the utmost importance, and has rendered the production
of good Negative Photographs of greater consequence
than any other branch of the Art.</p>

<p>The same Photograph may often be made to show either
as a Positive or as a Negative. For instance, supposing a
piece of silver-leaf to be cut into the shape of a cross and
pasted on a square of glass, the appearance presented by
it would vary under different circumstances.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/pg107.png" width="294" height="174" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 1.<span style="padding: 0 4em;">&nbsp;</span>Fig. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1 represents it placed on a layer of black velvet;
fig. 2 as held up to the light. If we term it Positive in
the first case, <i>i. e.</i> by reflected light, then it is Negative
in the second, that is, by transmitted light. The explanation
is obvious.</p>

<p>Therefore to carry our original definition of Positives
and Negatives a little further, we may say, that the former
are usually viewed by reflected, and the latter by transmitted,
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>All Photographs however cannot be made to represent
both Positives and Negatives. In order to possess this capability,
it is necessary that a part of the image should
be transparent, and the other opaque <i>but with a bright
surface</i>. These conditions are fulfilled when the Iodide of
Silver upon Collodion is employed, in conjunction with a
developing agent.</p>

<p>Every Collodion picture is to a certain extent both Negative
and Positive, and hence the processes for obtaining
both varieties of Photographs are substantially the same.
Although however the general characters of a Positive and
a Negative are similar, there are some points of difference.
A surface which appears perfectly opaque when looked
down upon, becomes somewhat translucent on being held
up to the light; hence, to give the same effect, the deposit
of metal in a Negative must be proportionally thicker
than in a positive; otherwise the minor details of the
image, will be invisible, from not obstructing the light sufficiently.</p>

<p>With these preliminary remarks, we are prepared to
investigate more closely the <i>rationale</i> of the processes
for obtaining Collodion Positives and Negatives. All that
refers to paper Positives upon Chloride of Silver will be
treated in a subsequent Chapter.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On Collodion Positives.</i></p>

<p>Collodion Positives are sometimes termed <i>direct</i>, because
obtained by a single operation. The Chloride of Silver,
<i>acted upon by light alone</i>, is not adapted to yield direct
Positives, the reduced surface being dark and incapable of
representing the lights of a picture. Hence a developing
agent is necessarily employed, and the Iodide of Silver
substituted for the Chloride, as being a more sensitive preparation.
Collodion Positives are closely allied in their
nature to Daguerreotypes. The difference between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
two consists principally in the surface used to sustain the
sensitive layer, and the nature of the substance by which
the invisible image is developed.</p>

<p>In a Collodion Positive the lights are formed by a bright
surface of reduced Silver, and the shadows by a black
background showing through the transparent portions of
the plate.</p>

<p>Two main points are to be attended to in the production
of these Photographs.</p>

<p>First, to obtain an image distinct in every part, <i>but of
comparatively small intensity</i>.&mdash;If the deposit of reduced
metal be too thick, the dark background is not seen to a
sufficient extent, and the picture in consequence is deficient
in shadow.</p>

<p>Secondly, to <i>whiten</i> the surface of the reduced metal
as much as possible, in order to produce a sufficient contrast
of light and shade. Iodide of Silver developed in
the usual way presents a dull yellow appearance which is
sombre and unpleasing.</p>

<p><i>The Collodion and Nitrate Bath for Positives.</i>&mdash;Good
Positives may be obtained by diluting down a sample of
Collodion with Ether and Alcohol until it gives a pale
bluish film in the Bath. The proportion of Iodide of Silver
being in that case small, the action of the high lights is
less violent, and the shadows are allowed more time to
impress themselves. The dilution lessens the amount of
Pyroxyline in the Collodion at the same time with the
Iodide, which is an advantage, the slight and transparent
films always giving more sharpness and definition in the
picture.</p>

<p>The employment of a very thin film for Positives is not
however always a successful process. The particles of the
Iodide of Silver being closely in contact with the glass,
unusual care is required in cleaning the plates in order to
avoid stains; and the amount of free Nitrate of Silver retained
upon the surface of the film being small, circular
patches of imperfect development are liable to occur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
unless the reducing agent be scattered evenly and perfectly
over the surface. Also if free Iodine or organic substances
which have a retarding effect on the action of light are
present to a considerable extent, the Collodion will not
work well with a small proportion of Iodide. The Author
found in experimenting on this subject that with perfectly
pure Collodion and a <i>neutral</i> Bath most vigorous impressions
were produced when the density of the film had
been so far reduced by dilution that scarcely anything
could be seen upon the glass; but with Collodion strongly
tinted with Iodine, or with a Bath containing Nitric Acid,
it was necessary to stop the dilution at a certain point or
the film became absolutely insensitive to feeble radiations
of light, and the shadows could not be brought out by
any amount of exposure. In this case, by adding more
Iodide a better effect was obtained.</p>

<p>A thicker Collodion may be used for positives if a little
free Iodine be added, for the purpose of diminishing intensity
and keeping the shadows clear during the development.
This process is easier to practice than the last, but
does not always give the same perfect definition.</p>

<p>No organic substance of the class to which Glycyrrhizine
and Sugars belong should be added to Collodion which is
to be used for Positives. By so doing the image would be
rendered intense, and the high lights liable to solarization,
<i>id est</i>, a dark appearance by reflected light.</p>

<p><i>The Nitrate Bath.</i>&mdash;If the materials are pure, the Nitrate
Bath may advantageously be diluted down at the
same time with the Collodion, when Positives are to be
taken; but the employment of a very weak Nitrate Bath
(such as one of 20 grains to the ounce), although highly
useful in obviating excess of development, has some disadvantages;
it becomes necessary to exclude free Nitric
Acid, and to avoid the employment of a Collodion too
highly tinted with Iodine. On the other hand, with a
strong Nitrate Bath, and a tolerably dense film of Iodide
of Silver, a better result is often secured by the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Nitric Acid. The sensitiveness of the plates is impaired,
but at the same time the intensity is diminished, and the
picture shows well upon the surface of the glass.</p>

<p>A new Bath is better for taking Positives than one
which has been a long time in use. The latter often causes
<i>haziness</i> and irregular markings on the film during the
action of the developer. This is due partly to the accumulation
of Alcohol and Ether in the Bath, which causes
the solution of Sulphate of Iron to flow in an oily manner;
and partly to a reduction of the Nitrate of Silver by organic
matter.</p>

<p>The presence of <i>Acetate of Silver</i> is objectionable in a
Positive Nitrate Bath as producing solarization and intensity
of image; hence those precautions which obviate
its formation must be adopted (<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>).</p>

<p>If fused Nitrate of Silver be used for the Positive Nitrate
Bath, it is very important that the fusion should not be carried
too far, or the solution would contain a basic Nitrite
of Silver, and yield an intense, solarized, and misty image.</p>

<p><i>The Developers for Collodion Positives.</i>&mdash;Pyrogallic Acid
when used with Acetic Acid, as is usual for negative pictures,
produces a surface which is dull and yellow. This
may be obviated by substituting Nitric Acid in small
<i>quantity</i> for the Acetic. The surface produced by Pyrogallic
Acid with Nitric Acid is lustreless, but very white,
if the solution be used of the proper strength. On attempting
to increase the amount of Nitric Acid the deposit
becomes metallic, and the half-tones of the picture
are injured; Pyrogallic Acid, although an active developer,
does not allow of the addition of mineral acid to the same
extent as the Salts of Iron. It requires also, when combined
with Nitric Acid, a fair proportion of Nitrate of
Silver on the film, or the development will be imperfect
in parts of the plate.</p>

<p><i>Sulphate of Iron.</i>&mdash;The Protosalts of Iron were first
employed in Photography by Mr. Hunt. The Sulphate is
a most energetic developer, and often brings out a picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
when others would fail. To produce by means of it a dead
white tint with absence of metallic lustre, it may be used
in conjunction with Acetic Acid, and in a somewhat concentrated
condition, so as to develope the picture quickly.</p>

<p>The addition of <i>Nitric Acid</i> to Sulphate of Iron modifies
the development, making it more slow and gradual,
and producing a bright sparkling surface of reduced Silver.
Too much of this acid however must not be used, or
the action will be irregular. The Nitrate Bath also must
be tolerably concentrated, in order to compensate for the
retarding effect of Nitric Acid upon the development. The
blue and transparent films of Iodide of Silver, formed in a
very dilute Nitrate Bath, are not well adapted for Positives
to be developed in this way. They are injured by the
acid, and the development of the image becomes imperfect.</p>

<p><i>Protonitrate of Iron.</i>&mdash;This salt, first used by Dr. Diamond,
is remarkable as giving a surface of brilliant metallic
lustre without any addition of free acid. Theoretically,
it may be considered as closely corresponding to the
Sulphate of Iron with Nitric Acid added. There are however
slight practical differences between them, which are
perhaps in favour of the Protonitrate.</p>

<p>The reducing powers of <i>Protoxide</i> of Iron appear to be
in inverse ratio to the strength of the acid with which it
is associated in its salts; hence the <i>Nitrate</i> is by far the
most feeble developer of the Protosalts of Iron.</p>

<p>The rules already given for the use of Sulphate of Iron
acidified with Nitric Acid, apply also to the Nitrate of
Iron; the proportion of free Nitrate of Silver must be
large, and the film of Iodide of Silver not too transparent.</p>

<p>In developing direct Positives either by Pyrogallic Acid
or the Salts of Iron, the colour of the image will be found
liable to some variation; the character of the light, whether
bright or feeble, and the length of exposure in the
Camera, affecting the result.</p>

<p><i>A Process for whitening the Positive Image by means of
Bichloride of Mercury.</i>&mdash;In place of brightening the Positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
image by modifying the developer, it was proposed
some time since by Mr. Archer to effect the same object
by the use of the salt known as <i>Corrosive Sublimate</i>, or
Bichloride of Mercury.</p>

<p>The image is first developed in the usual way, fixed, and
washed. It is then treated with the solution of Bichloride,
the effect of which is to produce almost immediately an
interesting series of changes in colour. The surface first
<i>darkens considerably</i>, until it becomes of an ash-grey, approaching
to black; shortly it begins to get lighter, and
assumes a <i>pure white</i> tint, or a white slightly inclining to
blue. It is then seen, on examination, that the whole substance
of the deposit is entirely converted into this white
powder.</p>

<p>The <i>rationale</i> of the reaction of Bichloride of Mercury
appears to be, that the Chlorine of the mercurial salt
divides itself between the Mercury and the Silver, a portion
of it passing to the latter metal and converting it into
a Protochloride. The white powder is therefore probably
a compound salt, as is further evidenced by the effects
produced on treating it with various reagents.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On Collodion Negatives.</i></p>

<p>As in the case of a direct Positive we require an image
which is <i>feeble</i> though distinct, so, on the other hand, for
a negative, it is necessary to obtain one of considerable intensity.
In the Chapter immediately following the present,
it will be shown that in using glass Negatives to produce
Positive copies upon Chloride of Silver paper, a good
result cannot be secured unless the Negative is sufficiently
dark to obstruct light strongly.</p>

<p><i>The Collodion and Nitrate Bath for Negatives.</i>&mdash;A Collodion
containing a very small portion of Iodide and yielding
a blue transparent film in the Bath is not well adapted
for taking Negatives. Pale opalescent films often give too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
little intensity in the high lights, and, unless the Nitrate
Bath be acid, do not admit of being exposed in the Camera
for the proper length of time without cloudiness and indistinctness
of image being produced under the action of
the developer. The effect known as "solarization of negatives,"
<i>i. e.</i> a red and translucent appearance of the
highest lights, is also more liable to occur when operating
with a very pale film. On the other hand, if the layer of
Iodide be too yellow and creamy, the half-tones of the
image will often be imperfectly developed, so that a middle
point between these extremes is the best.</p>

<p>A pure and newly prepared Collodion, although highly
sensitive to light, does not always give, with one application
of the developer, a sufficiently vigorous image to serve
as a negative matrix; and this particularly in the most
brightly illuminated parts, such as the sky in a landscape
photograph, or the white borders of an engraving. But
on keeping the Collodion for some weeks or months it
becomes yellow, if iodized with the alkaline iodides, and
a decomposition takes place in it, as before shown (<a href="#Page_97">p. 97</a>),
which lessens the rapidity of action, but adds to the intensity
of the negative.</p>

<p>Grape Sugar may be employed for the purpose of giving
intensity to newly mixed Collodion: also Glycyrrhizine,
which is a resinous body extracted from the root of Liquorice;
but as both substances have an effect in lessening
the sensitiveness and keeping qualities of the fluid, they
should be used cautiously. In taking portraits in the
open air, on bright days, and with a Bath which has been
mixed for a considerable time, it will rarely be found that
the intensity will be deficient; and especially so if the developer
be applied a second time to the film with a few
drops of solution of Nitrate of Silver added. In landscape
Photography however, or in copying engravings, where
extreme sensitiveness is not an object, the Glycyrrhizine
may sometimes be added with advantage in order to obtain
perfect opacity of the blacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>When the use of this substance is resorted to, the mode
of iodizing the Collodion appears to be of importance, the
increase of intensity being greater with the Iodide of
Cadmium than with the Iodides of the Alkalies; the latter
probably exercising a decomposing action. An addition
of a Bromide or a Chloride to the Collodion in small
quantity has also a marked effect in adding to the intensity
when Glycyrrhizine is used with alkaline Iodides
(<a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>).</p>

<p>Substances which produce intensity of the Collodion
image have often, if added in too large quantity, a tendency
to lower the half-tone, and prevent the darker parts
of the picture from being sufficiently brought out. The
print from the Negative is then pale and white, or "chalky"
as it is termed, in the high lights. Collodion in this condition
is often preferred by the beginner, from the facility
with which the Negatives are obtained, but it does
not give the finest results. An excess of Glycyrrhizine in
Collodion has also the effect of interfering with the precipitation
of the Iodide of Silver, producing a blue and
smoky film which is nearly useless for Negatives.</p>

<p>A judicious employment of free Iodine in Collodion
which has been previously intensified with Glycyrrhizine,
has a remarkable effect in improving the gradation of tone.
The excessive opacity of the high lights is diminished, and
hence the operator is enabled by a longer exposure of the
sensitive plate to bring out the shadows and minor details
of the image with great distinctness. Collodion prepared
in this manner is too slow to be used for portraits, excepting
in a strong light, but often gives an image with great
roundness and stereoscopic effect.</p>

<p>The Iodine and the liquorice sugar employed conjointly,
tend also to preserve the clearness of the plates under the
influence of the developer, and to give sharpness to the
lines and dots of engravings, etc., which, with a new
and sensitive Collodion, are often imperfectly rendered.
These advantages will be appreciated by the operator who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
has failed from working with a too feeble Collodion; but it
must be borne in mind, that all substances acting as intensifiers
have a bad effect when the state of the film is not
such as to call for their employment.</p>

<p>The Proto-iodide of Iron has been recommended as an
addition to Negative Collodion. In the Nitrate Bath it
forms, in addition to Iodide of Silver, Protonitrate of Iron,
an unstable substance and a developer. The use of Iodide
of Iron gives great sensibility, but it is difficult to preserve
it pure and unchanged. It also decomposes the Collodion
in the course of a few hours, becoming itself peroxidized,
and producing an insensitive condition of film. In addition
to this, the negatives taken by the aid of Iodide of
Iron are commonly of an inferior kind, the reduction
being too marked in the high lights; so that its employment
is of doubtful utility.</p>

<p><i>The Nitrate Bath.</i>&mdash;This should be prepared from Nitrate
of Silver which has been melted at a moderate heat
(see pp. <a href="#Page_13">13</a> and <a href="#Page_101">101</a>). If this point be neglected, the best
Collodion will sometimes fail in producing an intense negative.</p>

<p>Acetic Acid must be added in minute quantity, to
preserve the solution from a too ready reduction by the
Alcohol and Ether of the Collodion. Also, unless the Nitrate
of Silver be quite pure and free from organic matter
(<a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>), clear pictures will not be obtained without the use
of Acid.</p>

<p>Acetate of Silver has often been advised as an addition
to the Negative Nitrate Bath. It is produced by dropping
into the solution an alkali, such as Ammonia, followed
by Acetic Acid in excess. The Negatives are rendered
blacker and more vigorous by this proceeding, but especially
so when the Bath is contaminated with Nitric Acid;
which neutralizes itself at the expense of the Acetate of
Silver, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdl">Acetate of Silver</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitric Acid</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdl">Nitrate of Silver</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Acetic Acid.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>As a rule, it will be better to avoid adding Acetate of
Silver to the Bath, since with, pure melted Nitrate of Silver
no Nitric Acid can be present, and perfect intensity is
easily obtained. When the Bath is saturated with Acetate
of Silver, it is in a more reducible state, and hence unless
the glass plates are very perfectly cleaned, black lines and
markings, the results of irregular action, will be produced
on the application of the developer to the film (<a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>).
Solarization, or reddening by over-exposure, is also promoted
by the presence of Acetate of Silver.</p>

<p><i>Developing solutions for Negatives.</i>&mdash;The Protosalts of
Iron are not usually employed in developing Negative impressions.
They are liable to yield a violet-coloured image,
which cannot easily be rendered more intense by continuing
the action.</p>

<p>Gallic Acid is too feeble for developing Collodion pictures.
Pyrogallic Acid is much superior, and may be used of any
strength, according to the effect desired. When the light
is bad, the temperature low, and the Negative developes
slowly and appears blue and inky by transmitted light,
the proportion of the reducing agent should be increased.
But with an intense Collodion, on a clear summer's day,
the finest gradation is obtained with a weak solution, which
does not begin to act until the plate has been evenly covered.
A strong developer might in such, a case produce
too much opacity in the highest lights, and would probably
occasion stains of irregular reduction.</p>

<p><i>Modes of strengthening a finished impression which is
too feeble to be used as a Negative.</i>&mdash;The ordinary plan of
pushing the development cannot be applied with advantage
after the picture has been washed and dried. In that case,
if it is found to be too feeble to print well, its intensity may
be increased by one of the following methods.&mdash;</p>

<p>It must be premised however, that the same degree of
excellence is not to be expected in a Negative Photograph
which has been improperly developed in the first instance
and more especially if the exposure to light was too short.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Any "instantaneous Positive" may be rendered sufficiently
intense for a Negative, but in that case the shadows are
almost invariably imperfect.</p>

<p>1. <i>Treatment of the image with Sulphuretted Hydrogen
or Hydrosulphate of Ammonia.</i>&mdash;The object is to convert
the metallic Silver into <i>Sulphuret of Silver</i>, and if this
could be done it would be of service. The mere application
of an Alkaline Sulphuret has however but little effect
upon the image, excepting to darken its surface and destroy
the Positive appearance by reflected light; the structure
of the metallic deposit being too dense to admit of the
Sulphur reaching its interior.</p>

<p>Professor Donny ('Photographic Journal,' vol. i.) proposes
to obviate this by first converting the image into
the white Salt of Mercury and Silver by the application
of Bichloride of Mercury, and afterwards treating it with
solution of Sulphuretted Hydrogen or Hydrosulphate of
Ammonia. Negatives produced in this way are of a brown-yellow
colour by transmitted light, and opaque to chemical
rays to an extent which would not, <i>à priori</i>, have been
anticipated.</p>

<p>2. <i>MM. Barreswil and Davanne's process.</i>&mdash;The image
is converted into Iodide of Silver by treating it with a saturated
solution of Iodine in water. It is then washed&mdash;to
remove the excess of Iodine,&mdash;exposed to the light, and
a portion of the ordinary developing solution, mixed with
Nitrate of Silver, poured over it. The changes which ensue
are precisely the same as those already described; the
whole object of the process being to bring the metallic
surface back again into the condition of Iodide of Silver
modified by light, that the developing action may be commenced
afresh, and more Silver deposited from the Nitrate
in the usual way.</p>

<p>3. <i>The process with Bichloride of Mercury and Ammonia.</i>&mdash;The
image is first converted into the usual white
double Salt of Mercury and Silver by the application of
a solution of the Corrosive Sublimate. It is then treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with Ammonia, the effect of which is to <i>blacken</i> it intensely.
Probably the alkali acts by converting Chloride
of Mercury into the black Oxide of Mercury. In place
of Ammonia, a dilute solution of Hyposulphite of Soda
or Cyanide of Potassium may be used, with very similar
results.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ON THE THEORY OF POSITIVE PRINTING.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of Collodion Negatives having been explained
in the previous Chapter, we proceed to show how they may
be made to yield an indefinite number of copies with the
lights and shadows correct as in nature.</p>

<p>Such copies are termed "Positives," or sometimes
"Positive prints," to distinguish them from direct Positives
upon Collodion.</p>

<p>There are two distinct modes of obtaining photographic
prints;&mdash;first by development, or, as it is termed, <i>by the
Negative process</i>, in which a layer of Iodide or Chloride of
Silver is employed, and the invisible image developed by
Gallic Acid; and second, by the direct action of light upon
a surface of Chloride of Silver, no developer being used.
These processes, involving chemical changes of great delicacy,
require a careful explanation.</p>

<p>The action of light upon Chloride of Silver was described
in Chapter II. It was shown that a gradual process of
darkening took place, the compound being reduced to the
condition of a coloured <i>subsalt</i>; also, that the rapidity and
perfection of the change were increased by the presence of
excess of Nitrate of Silver, and of organic matters, such as
Gelatine, Albumen, etc.</p>

<p>We have now to suppose that a sensitive paper has
been prepared in this way, and that a Negative having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
been laid in contact with it, the combination has been exposed
to the agency of light for a sufficient length of time.
Upon removing the glass, a Positive representation of the
object will be found below, of great beauty and detail.
Now if this image were in its nature fixed and permanent,
or if there were means of making it so, without injury to
the tint, the production of Paper Positives would certainly
be a simple department of the Photographic Art; for it
will be found that with almost any Negative, and with sensitive
paper however prepared, the picture will look tolerably
well on its first removal from the printing-frame.
Immersion in the bath of Hyposulphite of Soda however,
which is essentially necessary in order to fix the picture,
produces an unfavourable effect upon the tint; decomposing
the violet-coloured Subchloride of Silver, and leaving
behind a red substance which appears to be united to
the fibre of the paper, and, when tested, reacts in the manner
of a Suboxide of Silver.</p>

<p>Other chemical operations are therefore required to remove
the objectionable red colour of the print, and hence
the consideration of the subject is naturally divided into
two parts; first, the means by which the paper is rendered
sensitive, and the image impressed upon it;&mdash;and secondly,
the subsequent fixing and <i>toning</i>, as it may be termed, of
the proof.</p>

<p>The present Chapter will also include, in two additional
Sections, a condensed account of the most important facts
relating to the properties and the mode of preservation of
photographic prints.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Preparation of the Sensitive Paper.</i></p>

<p>In this Section the general theory of the preparation of
Positive paper, in so far as it affects the tone and intensity
of the print, will be described; the reader being referred to
the second division of the Work for the formulæ required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Preparation of the Sensitive Paper.</i>&mdash;The conditions
which are required for producing a sharp and well
defined print are&mdash;that an even layer of Chloride of Silver
should exist upon the very surface of the paper, and that
the particles of this Chloride should be in contact with a
sufficient excess of Nitrate of Silver. These points have
been already referred to at an early part of the Work
(<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>).</p>

<p>The material used for <i>sizing</i> the paper is of importance.
English papers are usually sized with Gelatine, which is
a photographic agent, and acts chemically in forming the
image. Foreign papers on the other hand being sized with
starch only, require an addition of Gelatine, Caseine, or
Albumen, to retain the Salt at the surface of the paper,
and to assist in producing the picture: if otherwise, the
print will be flat and "mealy," as it is termed. Albumen
especially produces a beautifully smooth surface, and is
advantageously employed in printing small portraits and
stereoscopic subjects.</p>

<p>The uniform surface distribution of the Chloride of Silver
is sometimes interfered with by a faulty structure of the
paper, causing it to absorb liquids unevenly, and in consequence
the pictures, when removed from the printing frame,
appear <i>spotted</i>. Another cause producing the same effect,
is the employment of too weak a solution of Nitrate of
Silver, or the removal of the sheet from the Nitrate bath
before the Chloride of Ammonium has been perfectly decomposed;
it is thus rendered unequally sensitive at different
portions of the surface, and the prints have the
characteristic marbled appearance above referred to.</p>

<p>A sufficient excess of Nitrate of Silver being essential,
it is important to bear in mind, that the quantity of this
salt eventually remaining in the paper, is much influenced
by the manner in which the solution is applied. If it be
laid on by <i>floating</i>, then the proportion of Nitrate to that
of Chloride of Sodium should be about as 3 to 1 (the atomic
weights are nearly as 5 to 2); but if the plan of brushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
or spreading with a glass rod be adopted, 7 to 1 or 8 to 1
will not be too much.</p>

<p><i>The Darkening of the Sensitive Paper by Light.</i>&mdash;The
operator should be familiar with the changes of colour
which indicate the progress of the reduction of the sensitive
layer. Much in this respect depends upon the kind
of organic matter used, but there is always a regular sequence
of tints; in the case of a paper prepared simply
with Chloride of Ammonium and Nitrate of Silver, it is as
follows: pale violet, violet-blue, slate-blue, <i>bronze</i> or
copper-colour. When the <i>bronzed</i> stage is reached, there is
no further change. On immersion in the fixing bath of
Hyposulphite, the violet tones due to Subchloride of Silver
are destroyed, and the print assumes a red or brown colour,
which is deepest and most intense in the parts where the
light has acted longest.</p>

<p>Hence we see, that, to produce a good print, it is essential
that the Negative should possess considerable intensity
in the dark parts. Pale and feeble Negatives yield proofs
which are wanting in vigour, and have a flat and indistinct
appearance. The combination cannot be exposed to light
for a sufficient length of time to bring about the requisite
degree of reduction of the Chloride of Silver; and hence
the deepest shadows of the resulting Positive are not
sufficiently dark, and there is <i>a want of contrast</i> which is
fatal to the effect.</p>

<p>A good Negative should be so opaque as to preserve
the lights of the printed image beneath clear, <i>until the
darkest shades are about to pass into the bronze or coppery
condition</i>. If the amount of intensity be less than this,
the finest effect cannot be obtained.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE SENSITIVENESS OF THE PAPER
AND THE INTENSITY OF THE IMAGE.</p>

<p>Some of the principal of these are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>a. <i>The Strength of the Salting Bath.</i>&mdash;The sensibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the paper is regulated up to a certain point by the
amount of salt<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> used in the preparation. The quantity
of alkaline Chloride determines the amount of Chloride
of Silver; and with a proper excess of Nitrate of Silver,
papers are to a certain point more sensitive in proportion
as they contain more of the Chloride.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The difference in the atomic weights of the various soluble
Chlorides used in salting must be borne in mind. Ten grains of Chloride of
Ammonium contain as much Chlorine as eleven of Chloride of Sodium, or
twenty-two grains of Chloride of Barium. (See the Vocabulary, Part III.)</p></div>

<p>Highly sensitized papers darken rapidly, and pass very
completely into the bronze stage. Those containing less
Chloride darken more slowly, and do not become bronzed
with the same intensity of light. A Photographic print,
formed upon paper highly salted and sensitized, is usually
vigorous, with great contrast of light and shade; particularly
so when the printing is conducted in a strong light.
Hence it will be an advantage, with a feeble Negative, and
in dull weather, to <i>double</i> the ordinary quantity of Salt,
whereas in the case of an intense Negative, and with direct
sunlight, the deep shadows will be too much bronzed unless
the quantity of Chloride and Nitrate of Silver in the
paper be kept low.</p>

<p>In proportion as Photographic papers are highly salted
and sensitized, they become more prone to change colour
spontaneously in the dark.</p>

<p>b. <i>Proportion of Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;The compound on
which a positive print is formed is a Chloride, or an organic
Salt of Silver, <i>with an excess of Nitrate of Silver</i>. Nothing
is gained by increasing the proportion of Chloride of
Sodium, unless at the same time an addition be made to
the quantity of free Nitrate in the sensitizing Bath.</p>

<p>A surface of Chloride of Silver with a bare excess of
Nitrate, darkens on exposure, but it does not reach the
bronzed stage; the action appearing to stop at a certain
point. On placing the print in Hyposulphite of Soda, it
becomes very red and pale, and when tinted, looks cold and
slaty, without depth or intensity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>c. <i>The sensitiveness and intensity affected by substituting
the Oxide of Silver for the Nitrate.</i>&mdash;Many operators employ
a solution of Oxide of Silver in Ammonia<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or Nitrate
of Ammonia, in preparing Chloride of Silver paper. By
doing so, a great increase of sensitiveness, and also of intensity
of image, is obtained. This will be understood if
we remember that the action of light in producing the print
is of a reducing nature. Hence the substitution of Oxide
for Nitrate of Silver facilitates the decomposition; just as
<i>Ammonio-Nitrate</i> of Silver is more readily reduced by
Gallic or Pyrogallic Acid than the simple Nitrate (see p.
31).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The chemistry of Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver is explained in the
Vocabulary, Part III.</p></div>

<p>Ammonio-Nitrate paper has the disadvantage of soon
<i>discolouring</i> when kept; but it is very serviceable in
printing during the winter months. The proportion of
Chloride in the salting Bath may, if desired, be considerably
reduced; the intensity of action being greatly exalted
by the use of the Oxide of Silver.</p>

<p>d. <i>Employment of organic matters.</i>&mdash;Those recommended
in this work are&mdash;Albumen, Gelatine, and Iceland Moss.
Albumen adds much to the sensibility of the paper, and
gives very fine surface definition. A less amount of Chloride
is required than in the case of plain paper simply
salted, the glutinous character of Albuminous liquids
causing more of the fluid to be retained upon the surface
of the paper, and the animal matter assisting the reduction.
By varying the proportion of salt, both feeble and
intense Negatives may be printed successfully upon albuminized
paper. No process gives better results, either as
regards sensitiveness, or in faithfully rendering all the
finer details of the Negative, than the process with Albumen.</p>

<p>Iceland Moss, when boiled in water, yields a mucilaginous
liquid which is conveniently employed as a vehicle for
Chloride of Silver; it increases the sensitiveness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
paper and gives additional power of bronzing, by assisting
to reduce the free Nitrate of Silver. Many other organic
matters, tending to absorb oxygen, would act in the same
way.</p>

<p><i>Gelatine</i> is used in positive printing; it is analogous to
Albumen in composition, and, like it, forms a red compound
with Suboxide of Silver. It is serviceable in keeping
the print at the surface of the paper, but does not alter
the sensibility or the general appearance of the finished
picture so greatly as Albumen.</p>

<p>e. <i>Impurities in Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;Nitrate of Silver
used for Photographic printing should be free from even a
trace of Protonitrate of Mercury, since it is known that
the precipitation of Chloride of Mercury prevents the
darkening of Chloride of Silver by light.</p>

<p>The peculiar condition of Nitrate of Silver spoken of at
<a href="#Page_101">page 101</a>, in which it is thought to contain Oxides of Nitrogen,
is likely to interfere with Photographic printing.
This is probably the explanation of a faulty state of the
Nitrate solution, in which it yields red and feeble positives,
and does not darken in colour in exciting albuminized
paper. The remedy will be, to fuse the Nitrate of Silver
at a moderate heat before dissolving it.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE COLOUR OF THE IMAGE INFLUENCED BY THE PREPARATION
OF THE SENSITIVE PAPER.</p>

<p>This subject should be studied by those who desire to
print with taste. By introducing a few simple modifications
into the mode of preparing the sensitive paper, almost
any variety of tint may be obtained.</p>

<p>The tendency of the "toning" process, to which the
print is afterwards to be submitted, is to darken the colour,
and, if gold be used, to give a shade of <i>blue</i>. Hence,
if the Positive be printed of a red tone, it will change in
the gold Bath to a purple; whereas if left, after exposure
to light and fixing, of a dark brown or sepia tint, it passes
by toning into a pure black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The Positive should look warm and bright on its removal
from the printing frame; but the tint which remains
after immersion in Hyposulphite of Soda is the proper
colour of the simply fixed print.</p>

<p>The following points may be mentioned as affecting the
colour and general appearance of the picture.</p>

<p>a. <i>The proportions of Salt and Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;Highly
salted and sensitized papers give a <i>darker</i> image
than those which, containing a small proportion of Chloride
of Silver, are less sensitive to light. Hence in printing
upon paper weakly sensitized, in order to bring out the
finer details of a highly intense negative, we find the image
unusually red after fixing, and of a brown or mulberry
colour when toned. The above remarks apply also in
some degree to the strength of the Nitrate Bath, and
especially so when no organic matter excepting Gelatine
is employed,&mdash;in such a case the image will be <i>darker</i>
after fixing, if the proportion of free Nitrate of Silver be
large.</p>

<p>b. <i>Effect of Oxide of Silver on the colour.</i>&mdash;Prints formed
upon Ammonio-Nitrate papers highly salted are of a sepia
colour after fixing, and usually of a pure black or a purple-black
when toned. With the increased facility of reduction
by light afforded by use of <i>Oxide</i> of Silver, there is
also less redness in the print. But if the quantity of salt
used in preparing the paper be reduced to a minimum
(one grain to the ounce or less), for the sake of economy
or to improve the half-tone, then the usual red colour returns,
and the Positive is brown or purple after toning, in
place of black. Thus by employing a solution of Oxide
of Silver, the operator is enabled, without the addition of
organic matter, to print Positives of a pleasing variety of
tint, combined with a peculiar softness and delicacy, which
cannot easily be obtained with the simple Nitrate of
Silver.</p>

<p>c. <i>The colour affected by organic matter.</i>&mdash;Albumen is
coagulated by Nitrate of Silver, and forms a permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
gloss upon the paper. The sensitive albuminized paper
darkens in the sun to a chocolate-brown colour, which becomes
very red on immersion in the Hyposulphite. The
finished prints are clear and transparent; usually of a
brown tone, or with a shade of purple when the gold
Bath is newly made and active; pure blacks are not easily
obtained.</p>

<p>Iceland Moss affects the colour of the proof to a certain
extent, but less than Albumen; the finished prints are
nearly black if the paper is highly salted.</p>

<p>The Gelatinous sizing used for the English papers, and
obtained by boiling hides in water, and hardening the
product by an admixture of Alum, has a <i>reddening</i> influence
upon reduced Silver salts, analogous to that of Albumen,
or of Caseine, the characteristic animal principle of
milk. Positives printed upon English paper, commonly
assume some shade of brown more or less removed from
black; the darker tones being more readily obtained upon
the foreign papers.</p>

<p>Citrates and Tartrates have a marked effect upon the
colour of prints. Paper prepared with Citrate, in addition
to Chloride of Silver, darkens to a fine purple colour which
changes to brick-red in the fixing Bath. The Positives,
when toned, are usually of a violet-purple or of a bistre
tint, with a general aspect of warmth and transparency.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Processes for Fixing and Toning the Proof.</i></p>

<p>This part of the operation is one to which great attention
should be paid, in order to secure bright and lasting
colours: it involves more of delicate chemical change than
perhaps any other department of the Art.</p>

<p>The first point requiring explanation is the process of
fixing; to which (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) brief reference has already been
made. The methods adopted to improve the tint of the
finished picture will then be described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4nb">CONDITIONS OF A PROPER FIXING OF THE PROOF.</p>

<p>This subject is not always understood by operators, and
consequently they have no certain guide as to how long
the prints should remain in the fixing Bath.</p>

<p>The time occupied in fixing will of course vary with the
strength of the solution employed; but there are simple
rules which may be usefully followed. In the act of dissolving
the unaltered Chloride of Silver in the proof, the
fixing solution of Hyposulphite of Soda converts it into
Hyposulphite of Silver (<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>), which is soluble in an <i>excess</i>
of Hyposulphite of Soda. But if there be an insufficient
excess,&mdash;that is, if the Bath be too weak, or the print
removed from it too speedily,&mdash;then the Hyposulphite of
Silver is not perfectly dissolved, and begins by degrees to
<i>decompose</i>, producing a brown deposit in the tissue of the
paper. This deposit, which has the appearance of yellow
spots and patches, is not usually seen upon the surface of
the print, but becomes very evident when it is held up to
the light, or if it be split in half, which can be readily done
by gluing it between two flat surfaces of deal, and then
forcing them asunder.</p>

<p><i>The reaction of Hyposulphite of Soda with Nitrate of
Silver.</i>&mdash;In order to understand more fully how <i>decomposition</i>
of Hyposulphite of Silver may affect the process
of fixing, the peculiar properties of this salt should be
studied. With this view Nitrate of Silver and Hyposulphite
of Soda may be mixed in equivalent proportions,
viz. about twenty-one grains of the former salt to sixteen
grains of the latter, first dissolving each in separate vessels
in half an ounce of distilled water. These solutions are to
be added to each other and well agitated; immediately a
dense deposit forms, which is Hyposulphite of Silver.</p>

<p>At this point a curious series of changes commences.
The precipitate, at first white and curdy, soon alters in
colour: it becomes canary-yellow, then of a rich orange-yellow,
afterwards liver-colour, and finally black. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<i>rationale</i> of these changes is explained to a certain extent
by studying the composition of the Hyposulphite of Silver.
The formula for this substance is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
AgO S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.<br />
</p>

<p>But AgO S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plainly equals AgS, or Sulphuret of Silver,
and SO<sub>3</sub>, or Sulphuric Acid. The acid reaction assumed
by the supernatant liquid is due therefore to Sulphuric
Acid, and the black substance formed is Sulphuret of Silver.
The yellow and orange-yellow compounds are earlier
stages of the decomposition, but their exact nature is uncertain.</p>

<p>The instability of Hyposulphite of Silver is principally
seen when it is in an isolated state: the presence of an excess
of Hyposulphite of Soda renders it more permanent,
by forming a double salt, as already described.</p>

<p>In fixing Photographic prints, this brown deposit of Sulphuret
of Silver is very liable to form in the Bath and
upon the picture; particularly so when the <i>temperature</i> is
high. To obviate it, observe the following directions:&mdash;It
is especially in the reaction between <i>Nitrate of Silver</i>
and Hyposulphite of Soda that the blackening is seen;
the Chloride and other <i>insoluble</i> Salts of Silver being dissolved,
even to saturation, without any decomposition of
the Hyposulphite formed. Hence if the print be washed
in water to remove the soluble Nitrate, a very much
weaker fixing Bath than usual may be employed. But if
the proofs are taken at once from the printing frame and
immersed in a dilute Bath of Hyposulphite (one part of
the salt to six or eight of water), <i>a shade of brown</i> may
often be observed to pass over the surface of the print,
and a large deposit of Sulphuret of Silver soon forms as
the result of the decomposition. On the other hand, with
a strong Hyposulphite Bath there is little or no discoloration,
and the black deposit is absent.</p>

<p>The print must also be left for a sufficient time in the
fixing bath, or some appearance of brown patches,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
by transmitted light, may occur. Each atom of Nitrate
of Silver requires <i>three</i> atoms of Hyposulphite of Soda to
form the <i>sweet and soluble double salt</i>, and hence, if the
action be not continued sufficiently long, another compound
will be formed almost tasteless and insoluble (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>).
Even immersion in a new Bath of Hyposulphite of
Soda does not fix the print when once the yellow stage of
decomposition has been established. This yellow salt is
insoluble in Hyposulphite of Soda, and consequently remains
in the paper.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The writer has noticed that when sensitive paper is <i>kept
for some time</i> before being used for printing, these yellow patches of
imperfect fixation are very liable to occur. The Nitrate of Silver appears
gradually to enter into combination with the organic matter of the size of
the paper, and cannot then be so easily extracted by the fixing bath.</p></div>

<p>In fixing prints by Ammonia the Author has found that
the same rule may be applied as in the case of Hyposulphite
of Soda, viz. that if the process be not properly
performed, the white parts of the print will appear <i>spotted</i>
when held up to the light, from a portion of insoluble
Silver Salt remaining in the paper. Prints imperfectly
fixed by Ammonia are also usually brown and discoloured
upon the surface of the paper.</p>

<p>More exact directions as to the strength of the fixing
bath and the time occupied in the process, will be given
in the Second Part of the Work; at present it may be noticed
only that <i>Albuminized</i> paper, from the horny nature
of its surface-coating, requires a longer treatment with the
Hyposulphite than the plain paper.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE SALTS OF GOLD AS TONING AGENTS FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS.</p>

<p>The Salts of Gold have been successfully applied to the
improvement of the tones obtained by simply fixing the
proof in Hyposulphite of Soda. The following are the
principal modes followed:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>M. Le Grey's Process.</i>&mdash;The print, having been exposed
to light until it becomes very much darker than it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
intended to remain, is washed in water to remove the excess
of Nitrate of Silver. It is then immersed in a dilute solution
of Chloride of Gold, acidified by Hydrochloric Acid.
The effect is to reduce the intensity considerably, and at
the same time to change the dark shades to a violet or
bluish tint. After a second washing with water, the proof
is placed in plain Hyposulphite of Soda, which fixes it and
alters the tone to a pure black or a blue-black, according
to the manner of preparing the paper and the time of exposure
to light.</p>

<p>The <i>rationale</i> of the process appears to be as follows:&mdash;
the Chlorine, previously combined with Gold, passes to the
reduced Silver Salt; it bleaches the lightest shades, by
converting them again into white Protochloride of Silver,
and gives to the others a violet tint more or less intense
according to the reduction. At the same time metallic
Gold is deposited, the effect of which is not visible at this
stage, since the same violet tint is perceived when a solution
of <i>Chlorine</i> is substituted for Chloride of Gold.</p>

<p>The Hyposulphite of Soda subsequently employed, decomposes
the violet Subchloride of Silver, and leaves the
surface of a black tint, due to the Gold and the reduced
Silver Salt.</p>

<p>M. Le Grey's process is objectionable on account of the
excessive over-printing required. This however is to a
great extent obviated by a modification of the process in
which an <i>alkaline</i> instead of an acid solution of the Chloride
is employed; one grain of Chloride of Gold is dissolved
in about six ounces of water, to which are added
twenty to thirty grains of the common Carbonate of Soda.
The alkali moderates the violence of the action, so that
the print washed with water and immersed in the Gold
Bath, is less reduced in intensity, and does not acquire
the same <i>inky</i> blueness. On subsequent fixing in the Hyposulphite,
the tint changes from violet to a dark chocolate-brown,
which is permanent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Tetrathionate and Hyposulphite of Gold employed
in toning.</i>&mdash;After the discovery of Le Grey's mode, it was
proposed, as an improvement, to add Chloride of Gold to
the fixing solution, so as to obviate the necessity of using
two Baths. The print, in that case, although darkened
considerably, is less reduced in intensity, and the same
amount of over-printing is not required. The chemical
changes which ensue are different from before: they may
be described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Chloride of Gold, added to Hyposulphite of Soda, is
converted into Hyposulphite of Gold, Tetrathionate of
Gold, and (if the Chloride of Gold be free from excess of
acid) a red compound, containing more of the metal than,
either of the others, but the exact nature of which is uncertain.
Each of these three Gold Salts possesses the
property of darkening the print, but not to the same extent.
The activity is less as the stability of the salt is
greater, and hence the red compound, which is so highly
unstable that it cannot be preserved many hours without
decomposing and precipitating metallic Gold, is far more
active than the Hyposulphite of Gold, which, when associated
with an excess of Hyposulphite of Soda, is comparatively
permanent.</p>

<p>When rapidity of colouring is an object it will therefore
be advisable to add Chloride of Gold to the fixing Bath of
Hyposulphite rather than an equivalent quantity of Sel
d'or; and by dropping a little Ammonia into the Chloride
of Gold so as to precipitate "fulminating gold"<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> (a compound
which dissolves in Hyposulphite of Soda with considerable
formation of the unstable red salt), the activity
of the Bath will be promoted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Read the observations on the Explosive Properties of Fulminating Gold
in the Vocabulary, Part III.</p></div>

<p>The Author explains the action of these Salts of Gold
upon the Positive print as follows:&mdash;they are unstable, and
contain an excess of Sulphur loosely combined; hence,
when placed in contact with the image, which has an
affinity for Sulphur, the existing compound is broken up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and Sulphuret of Silver, Sulphuric Acid, and metallic
Gold are the results. That a minute proportion of Sulphuret
of Silver is formed seems certain; but the change
must be superficial, as the stability of the print is very
little lessened when the process is properly performed.</p>

<p><i>Sel Or employed as a toning agent.</i>&mdash;This process,
which was communicated to the 'Photographic Journal'
by Mr. Sutton of Jersey, has been found serviceable.</p>

<p>The prints are first washed in water, to which is added
a little Chloride of Sodium, to decompose the free Nitrate
of Silver. They are then immersed in a dilute solution
of "Sel d'or," or double Hyposulphite of Gold and Soda,
which quickly changes the tint from red to purple without
destroying any of the details or lighter shades. Lastly,
the Hyposulphite of Soda is employed to fix the print in
the usual way.</p>

<p>This process differs theoretically from the last in some
important particulars. The toning solution is applied to
the print <i>before fixing</i>, which experience proves to have
an important influence upon the result, it having been
found that when the print is previously acted upon by
Hyposulphite of Soda, the rapidity of deposition of the
Gold is interfered with;&mdash;thus, a dilute solution of Sel
d'or colours a print rapidly, but if to this same liquid a
few crystals of Hyposulphite of Soda be added, the picture
becomes red and may be kept in the Bath for comparatively
a long time without acquiring the purple tones.</p>

<p>As Hyposulphite of Soda in excess lessens the action of
the Sel d'or, so on the other hand the addition of an acid
increases it. The acid does not precipitate <i>Sulphur</i>, as
might be expected from a knowledge of the reaction of
Hyposulphite with acid bodies (<a href="#Page_137">p. 137</a>), but it favours the
reduction of metallic Gold. Hence it is usual to add a
little Hydrochloric Acid to the toning solution of Sel d'or,
to increase the rapidity and perfection of the colouring
process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT THE ACTION OF THE
FIXING AND TONING BATH OF GOLD AND HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA.</p>

<p>Although the process of toning Positives by Sel d'or is
very certain in its results and gives good tints, yet, as involving
a somewhat greater expenditure of time and trouble,
it is not at present universally adopted. The ordinary
plan of fixing and toning in one bath has been proved to
yield permanent prints if the proper precautions are observed,
but it is quite necessary, in order to ensure success,
that the conditions by which its action is modified
should be understood. The more important of these are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>a. <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">AGE</span> <i>of the Bath.</i>&mdash;When Chloride of Gold is
added to Hyposulphite of Soda, several unstable salts are
produced, which decompose by keeping. Hence the solution
is very active during the first few days after mixing;
but at the expiration of some weeks or months, if not
used, it becomes almost inert, a reddish deposit of Gold
first forming, and eventually a mixture of black Sulphuret
of Silver and Sulphur, the former of which often adheres
to the sides of the bottle in dense shining laminæ.</p>

<p>When the Bath is constantly kept in use there is a loss
of Gold, which, although it is less perceived than it otherwise
would be, from the fact that sulphuretting principles
are formed (see next page) capable of replacing the Gold
as toning agents&mdash;yet makes the Bath work more slowly,
and hence over-printing is required.</p>

<p>b. <i>Presence of free Nitrate of Silver upon the surface of
the proof.</i>&mdash;This produces an accelerating effect, as may
be shown by soaking the print in salt and water, to convert
the Nitrate into Chloride of Silver; the action then
takes place more slowly.</p>

<p>The free Nitrate of Silver increases the instability of
the Gold salts; but if present in too great an excess, it is
apt to cause a decomposition of Hyposulphite of Silver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and consequent yellowness in the white parts of the proof.
It is therefore particularly recommended to wash the
print in water before immersing it in the fixing and toning
Bath.</p>

<p>c. <i>Temperature of the solution.</i>&mdash;In cold weather, the
thermometer standing at 32° to 40°, the Bath works more
slowly than usual; whereas in the height of summer, and
especially in hot climates, it occasionally becomes quite
unmanageable. The best temperature for operating successfully
appears to be about 60° to 65° Fahrenheit; if
higher than this the solutions must be employed more
dilute.</p>

<p>d. <i>Addition of Iodide of Silver.</i>&mdash;Some operators associate
Iodide with Chloride in the preparation of sensitive
paper for printing. Another source of the same salts is
the admixture of a portion of the fixing Bath used for Negatives
with the Positive toning solution. The presence
of Iodides in the fixing and toning Bath is injurious: when
in large excess, they dissolve the image, or produce yellow
patches of Iodide of Silver on the lights; in smaller
quantity, the deposition of the Gold is hindered, and the
action proceeds more slowly. Bromides and Chlorides
have not the same effect.</p>

<p>e. <i>Mode of preparing the paper.</i>&mdash;The rapidity of toning
varies with causes independent of the Bath: thus, plain
paper prints are toned more quickly than prints upon albuminized
paper, and the use of English paper sized with
Gelatine retards the action. Foreign papers rendered sensitive
with Ammonio-Nitrate tone the most quickly.</p>

<p><i>On certain states of the fixing and toning Bath which
are injurious to the proofs.</i>&mdash;The object of using the Hyposulphite
Bath is to fix the proof and to tone it by means
of Gold. But it is a fact familiar to the photographic chemist,
that Positives can also be toned by a sulphuretting
action, and that the colours so obtained are not very different
from those which follow the employment of Gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Now the Hyposulphite of Soda is a substance which can
be very readily made to yield up Sulphur to any bodies
which possess an affinity for that element, and as the reduced
Silver compound in the print has such an affinity,
there is always a tendency to absorption of Sulphur when
the proofs are immersed in the Bath. Consequently in
many cases a sulphur toning-process is set up, and as the
picture is improved by it in appearance, losing its brick-red
colour and assuming a purple shade, it was at first
adopted by Photographers. Experience however has shown
that colours brightened in this way are less permanent
than others, and are liable to fade unless kept perfectly
dry. Hence the process will be discarded by all careful
operators, and the object will be to avoid sulphuration as
far as possible. This can be done to a great extent,
and, when the Bath is properly managed, the prints will
be toned almost entirely by Gold, and will, with care, be
permanent.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> For a more detailed account of the toning process by Sulphur, see the
Third Section of this Chapter, <a href="#Page_145">page 145</a>. The instability of sulphuretted
prints is shown in the fourth Section.</p></div>

<p>Some of the conditions which facilitate a sulphuretting
action upon the proof are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>a. <i>The addition of an Acid to the Bath.</i>&mdash;It was at one
time common to add a few drops of Acetic Acid to the
fixing Bath of Hyposulphite of Soda, immediately before
immersing the proofs. The Bath then assumes an opalescent
appearance in the course of a few minutes, and, when
this milkiness is perceptible, the print begins to <i>tone</i> rapidly
and becomes nearly black.</p>

<p>The chemical changes produced in a Hyposulphite Bath
by addition of acid, may be explained thus:&mdash;The acid first
displaces the feeble Hyposulphurous acid from its combination
with Soda.</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdl">Acetic Acid</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Hyposulphite Soda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>=</td>
  <td class="tdl">Acetate Soda</td>
  <td class="tdc">+</td>
  <td class="tdl">Hyposulphurous Acid.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Then the Hyposulphurous Acid, <i>not being a stable substance
when isolated</i>, begins spontaneously to decompose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and splits up into Sulphurous Acid&mdash;which remains dissolved
in the liquid, communicating the characteristic odour
of burning Sulphur&mdash;and <i>Sulphur</i>, which separates in a
finely divided state and forms a milky deposit.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> From the Vocabulary, Part III., it will be seen that commercial
Chloride of Gold usually contains <i>free Hydrochloric Acid</i>; hence a
considerable deposit of Sulphur takes place on adding it to the Hyposulphite
solution, and the liquid must not be used immediately.</p></div>

<p>Observe therefore that free acids of all kinds must be
excluded from the fixing Bath, or, if inadvertently added,
the liquid must be set aside for some hours until the
Hyposulphurous Acid has decomposed, and, the Sulphur
having settled to the bottom, the Bath has regained its
original neutral condition.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The chemical reader will understand the decomposition of free
Hyposulphurous Acid by the following equation:&mdash;S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = SO<sub>2</sub> and S.</p></div>

<p>b. <i>Decomposition of the Bath by constant use.</i>&mdash;It has
long been known that a solution of Hyposulphite of Soda
undergoes a peculiar change in properties when much used
in fixing. When first prepared it leaves the image of a red
tone, the characteristic colour of the reduced Silver Salt,
but soon acquires the property of darkening this red colour
by a subsequent communication of Sulphur. Hence
a simple fixing Bath becomes at last an active toning
bath, without any addition of Gold.</p>

<p>This change of properties will be found more fully explained
in the abstract of the Author's researches given in
the next Section (<a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>). At present we remark only that
it is due principally to a reaction between Nitrate of Silver
and Hyposulphite of Soda, attended with decomposition of
Hyposulphite of Silver (<a href="#Page_130">p. 130</a>); and hence, if the prints
are washed in water before immersion in the Bath, the solution
will be less quickly liable to change.</p>

<p>Many operators state that the toning Bath having at
first been prepared with Chloride of Gold, no further addition
of this substance will be required. This no doubt
is correct, but in such case the proofs will at last be toned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
by Sulphur more than by Gold, and will not possess the
same stability; the Bath will also, after long use, be found
to acquire a distinct <i>acid</i> reaction to test-paper, the acidity
being due to a peculiar principle generated by decomposing
Hyposulphite of Silver, and which is shown to have an
injurious action upon the print (<a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>). To avoid this the
solution should be kept <i>neutral to test-paper</i> by means of
a drop of Ammonia, if required; and when it begins to be
exhausted, and does not tone (quickly) a print from which
the free Nitrate of Silver has been removed by washing, a
fresh quantity of Chloride of Gold should be added.</p>

<p>c. <i>Tetrathionate in the Hyposulphite Bath.</i>&mdash;The Author
has shown that the Tetrathionates, which are analogous
to the Hyposulphites, have an active sulphuretting action
upon Positive prints (see the papers in the next Section).
Very fine colours can be obtained in this way; but toning
by Sulphur having been proved to be wrong in principle,
the formulæ given in the first two editions of this Work
have been omitted.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The bodies which produce Tetrathionate when added

of Gold and Soda when added to the fixing Bath (<a href="#Page_133">p. 133</a>);

<p class="tdc"><i>The Author's Researches in Photographic Printing.</i></p>

<p>Having been long engaged in conducting experiments
upon the composition and properties of the reduced material
forming the Photographic image, and especially with
a view of determining the exact conditions under which
the picture may be considered permanent, the Author
has thought it advisable to give the results of these researches
in the form of an abstract of the original papers
read at the meetings of the Photographic Society.</p>

<p>A previous perusal of these papers will put the reader
in possession of the principal facts upon which are founded
the precautions advised in the next Section for the preservation
of Photographic prints. In order to keep the Work
as nearly as possible within its original limits, and also for
the purpose of distinguishing the present Section from the
others, as one referring principally to scientific details,
the type has been reduced to the size of that used in the
Appendix.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE.</p>

<p>The determination of the chemical nature of the Photographic
image in its various forms is a point of much importance, both
as indicating the conditions required for the preservation of
works of art of that class, and also as a guide to the experimenter
in selecting bodies likely to have an effect as chemical
agents in Photography.</p>

<p>It has been stated by some who have given attention to the subject,
that the image is formed in all cases of pure metallic Silver,
and that any observable variations in its colour and properties,
are due to a difference in the molecular arrangement of the particles.
But this hypothesis, although involving much that is
correct, yet does not contain the whole truth, for it is evident
that the chemical properties of the Photographic image often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
bear no resemblance to those of a metal. One Photograph may
also differ essentially from another, so that we are led to infer the
existence of two varieties, the first of which is less of a metallic
nature than the second.</p>

<p>In investigating the subject, the principal point appeared to be
to examine the action of light upon Chloride of Silver, and afterwards
to associate the Chloride with organic matter in order to
imitate the conditions under which Photographs are obtained.</p>

<p>The following is an epitome of the conclusions arrived at:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Action of Light upon Chloride of Silver.</i>&mdash;The process is accompanied
by a separation of Chlorine, but its product is not a
mere mixture of Chloride of Silver and Metallic Silver; if it were
so, we cannot suppose that the darkening would take place beneath
the surface of Nitric Acid, which it is found to do. A definite
Subchloride of Silver seems to be formed, the most important
property of which is its decomposition by fixing agents, such
as Ammonia, and Hyposulphite of Soda, both of which destroy
the violet colour, dissolving out Protochloride of Silver, and
leaving a small quantity of a grey residue of metallic Silver.</p>

<p>Inasmuch therefore as all Photographic pictures require fixing,
we may conclude that if they could be produced upon pure and
isolated Chloride of Silver (which however is not the case), they
would consist solely of metallic Silver.</p>

<p><i>Decomposition of organic Salts of Silver by Light.</i>&mdash;Compounds
of Oxide of Silver with organic bodies, are as a rule darkened by
exposure to light, but the process does not always consist in a
simple reduction to the metallic state. This assertion is proved
by the employment of the following tests.</p>

<p>a. <i>Mercury.</i>&mdash;Little or no amalgamation takes place on triturating
the darkened salt with this metal.</p>

<p>b. <i>Ammonia and fixing agents.</i>&mdash;These usually produce only
a limited amount of action. Thus, the Albuminate of Protoxide
of Silver is perfectly soluble in Ammonia; but after having been
reddened by exposure to light, it is little or not at all affected.</p>

<p>c. <i>Potash.</i>&mdash;Animal matters coagulated by Nitrate of Silver,
and reduced by the sun's rays, are dissolved by boiling Potash,
the solution being clear and of a blood-red colour. Metallic
Silver, it is presumed, if present, would remain insoluble.</p>

<p>d. <i>Boiling Water.</i>&mdash;Gelatine treated with Nitrate of Silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and exposed to light, loses its characteristic property of dissolving
in hot water. This experiment is conclusive.</p>

<p>The above facts justify us in supposing the existence of combinations
of organic matter with a low Oxide of Silver; and
analysis indicates further that the relative proportion of each
constituent in these compounds may vary. For instance, when
Citrate of Silver is reduced by light, and acted on with Ammonia,
a black powder remains, which was found to contain as much as
95 per cent, real Silver; but Albuminate of Silver treated in the
same way yields on analysis less of metallic Silver, and more volatile
and carbonaceous matter.</p>

<p>The use of <i>Ammonio</i>-Nitrate of Silver in preparing the salt
tends also to increase the relative quantity of metal left in the
compound after reduction and fixing. The length of time during
which the light has acted, has also a modifying effect of the
same kind,&mdash;the product of reduction by a powerful light being
more nearly in the state of metal, and containing less both of
Oxygen and organic matter.</p>

<p><i>Action of Light upon Chloride of Silver associated with organic
matter.</i>&mdash;Photographs formed on Chloride of Silver alone,
would, after fixing, consist of metallic Silver, but such a process
could not be carried out in practice. The addition of organic
matter is absolutely necessary in order to increase the sensitiveness,
and to prevent the image from being dissolved in the Bath
of Hyposulphite of Soda. The blue Subchloride of Silver is decomposed
by fixing, a very scanty proportion of grey metallic
Silver remaining insoluble; but the red compound of Suboxide
of Silver with organic matter is almost unaffected by Hyposulphite
of Soda, or Ammonia.</p>

<p>The increase of sensitiveness and intensity produced by the use
of organic matter is accompanied also by a change in the composition
of the picture; the image losing the metallic character
which it possesses when formed on pure Chloride of Silver, and
resembling in every respect the product of the action of light
upon organic Salts of Silver.</p>

<p>There are certain characteristic tests which may usefully be
employed in distinguishing the metallic image from what may
be termed the organic or non-metallic image. One of these tests
is Cyanide of Potassium. An image formed upon pure Chloride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of Silver, although pale and feeble, may, after fixing, be immersed
ill dilute solution of Cyanide of Potassium without injury. But
a photograph on Chloride of Silver supported by an organic basis,
is much acted upon by Cyanide of Potassium, quickly losing its
finer details.</p>

<p>A second test is the Hydrosulphate of Ammonia. If no organic
matter be employed, the image becomes darker and more intense
by treatment with a soluble Sulphuret; whilst the non-metallic
image, formed on an organic surface, is quickly bleached and faded.
The action of Sulphur upon the image is indeed a mode of determining
the real quantity of Silver present. When existing in a
very finely divided layer, Sulphuret of Silver often appears yellow;
but in a thicker layer it is black. Hence the colour of the Photograph,
after treatment with Sulphuretted Hydrogen, is an
indication of the proportion of metal present, and the reason of
the organic image becoming so perfectly faded is because it contains
a minimum of Silver in relation to the intensity. We see,
therefore, that the addition of organic matter to Chloride of Silver
does not so much increase the actual quantity of Silver reduced
by light, as it adds to its opacity by associating other elements with
the Silver, and altogether modifying the composition of the image.</p>

<p>The employment of <i>oxidizing agents</i> shows also that in an ordinary
Photographic process by the direct action of light, other
elements besides Silver assist in forming the image: the pictures
being found to be easily susceptible of oxidation, whereas the metallic
image formed on pure Chloride of Silver resists oxidation.</p>

<p><i>Composition of</i> <span class="smcap">developed</span> <i>images.</i>&mdash;By exposing sensitive
layers of the Iodide, the Bromide, and the Chloride of Silver to
the light for a short time only, and subsequently developing with
Gallic Acid, Pyrogallic Acid, and the protosalts of Iron, a variety
of images may be obtained, which differ from each other materially
in every important particular, and a comparison of which
assists the determination of the disputed point.</p>

<p>The appearance and properties of the developed Photograph
are found to vary with the existence of the following conditions.</p>

<p>1st. <i>The surface used to sustain the sensitive layer.</i>&mdash;There is
a peculiarity in the image formed on <i>Collodion</i>. Collodion contains
Pyroxyline, a substance which behaves towards the salts of
Silver in a manner different from that of most organic bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
exhibiting no tendency to assist their reduction by light. Hence
Chloride of Silver on Collodion darkens far more slowly than the
same salt upon Albumen, and the image, after fixing, is feeble and
metallic. Iodide of Silver on Collodion, exposed and developed,
gives usually a more metallic image, with less intensity, than Iodide
of Silver upon Albumen, or on paper sized with Gelatine. By
adding to the Collodion a body which has an affinity for low
oxides of Silver, such for instance as Glycyrrhizine, the opacity
of the developed image is increased.</p>

<p>2nd. <i>The nature of the sensitive salt.</i>&mdash;When Iodide of Silver
is used to receive the latent impression, the image after development,
although lacking intensity of colour by reflected light, is
more nearly in the condition of metallic Silver than if Bromide
or Chloride of Silver be substituted; and of the three salts, the
Chloride gives the most intensity, with the least quantity of metallic
Silver. This rule applies especially when organic matters,
Gelatine, Glycyrrhizine, etc., are present.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>The developing agent employed.</i>&mdash;An organic developing
agent like Pyrogallic Acid may be expected to produce a Collodion
image more intense, but less metallic, than an inorganic developer,
such as the Protosulphate of Iron.</p>

<p>4th. <i>The length of time during which the light has acted.</i>&mdash;Over-action
of the light favours the production of an image which
is dark by reflection and brown or red by transmission, corresponding
in these particulars to what may be termed the non-metallic
image containing an oxide of Silver.</p>

<p>5th. <i>The stage of the development.</i>&mdash;The red image first formed
on the application of the developer to a gelatinized or albuminized
surface of Iodide of Silver is less metallic, and more easily injured
by destructive tests, than the black image, which is the result of
prolonging the action. Developed photographs which are of a
bright red colour after fixing, correspond in properties to images
obtained by the direct action of light on paper prepared with
Chloride of Silver, more nearly than to Collodion, or even to
fully developed Talbotype Negatives.</p>

<p>To conclude the Paper, the following may be offered in the
way of recapitulation:&mdash;An image consisting of metallic silver,
as a rule, reflects white light, and shows as a positive when laid
on black velvet; but a non-metallic organic image is dark, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
represents the shadows of a picture. Collodion positives developed
with protosalts of Iron are nearly or quite metallic. Photographs
on Albumen or Gelatine less so than those on Collodion.
Developed Photographs contain more Silver than others, if the
development has been prolonged. The half shadows of the image
in a Positive Print are especially liable to suffer under injurious
conditions, since they contain the Silver in a less perfect state of
reduction.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The Author omits, in this place, all mention of molecular conditions
affecting intensity, inasmuch as at the present time nothing positive has
been determined with regard to them. It is however known that in the use
of the protosalts of Iron as developing agents, the appearance of the image
is much influenced by the rapidity with which the reduction is effected&mdash;the
particles of Silver being larger and more metallic when the development is
conducted slowly. The process of electro-plating and other chemical operations
of a similar kind prove that the physical properties of metals precipitated
from solutions of their salts, vary greatly with the degree of fineness
and arrangement of their particles.</p></div>


<p class="caption4nb">ON THE VARIOUS AGENCIES DESTRUCTIVE TO PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS.</p>

<p><i>Action of Sulphuretting Compounds upon Positive Prints.</i>&mdash;It
was first noticed by Mr. T. A. Malone, that the most intense
Photograph might be destroyed by acting upon it with solution
of Sulphuretted Hydrogen or a soluble Sulphuret, for a sufficient
length of time.</p>

<p>The changes produced by a sulphuretting compound acting
upon the red image of a simply fixed print are these:&mdash;the colour
is first darkened, and a degree of brilliancy imparted to it; this
is the effect termed "toning." Then the warm tint by degrees
alters to a colder shade, the <i>intensity</i> of the whole image is lessened,
and the half-tones turn yellow. Lastly, the full shadows
pass also from black to yellow, and the print fades.</p>

<p>Now in this peculiar reaction we notice the following points
of interest. If at that particular stage at which the print has
reached its maximum of blackness, it be raised partially out of the
liquid and allowed to project into the air, the part so treated
becomes yellow before that which remains immersed. Again, if
a print toned by Sulphur be placed in a pan of water to wash,
after the lapse of several hours it is apt to assume a faded appearance
in the half-tones. The full shadows, in which the reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Silver salt is thicker and more abundant, retain their black colour
for a longer time, but if the action of the sulphuretting Bath
be continued, every portion of the print becomes yellow.</p>

<p>These facts prove that <i>Oxygen</i> has an influence in accelerating
the destructive action of the Sulphur compounds upon Positive
prints; and this idea is borne out by the results of further experiments,
for it is found that moist Sulphuretted Hydrogen has
little or no effect in darkening the colour when every trace of air
is excluded. When prints are washed in water they are exposed
to the influence of the dissolved air which water always contains,
and hence the change from black to yellow is produced.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Further remarks upon the action of damp air upon Positives toned by
Sulphur are given at <a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>.</p></div>

<p>There are some substances which facilitate the yellow degeneration
of Positives toned by Sulphur, a knowledge of which will
be useful: they are&mdash;1st, powerful oxidizers, such as Chlorine,
Permanganate of Potash, and Chromic Acid; these, even when
highly diluted, act with great rapidity: 2nd, bodies which dissolve
Oxide of Silver, as soluble Cyanides, Hyposulphites, Ammonia;
also <i>acids</i> of various kinds, and hence the frequency of
yellow finger impressions upon old sulphuretted prints, which
are probably caused by a trace of organic (Lactic?) Acid left by
contact with the warm hand.</p>

<p>It was at one time supposed that the Photograph in the stage
at which it appears <i>blackened</i> by Sulphur, consisted of Sulphuret
of Silver, and that this black Sulphuret became yellow by
absorption of Oxygen and conversion into Sulphate. MM. Davanne
and Girard, who examined the subject, thought that there
might be two isomeric forms of Sulphuret of Silver, a black and
a yellow form; the former of which passing gradually into the
latter produced the fading of the impression. But neither of
these views are correct; for it is proved by careful experiment,
that the Sulphuret of Silver is a highly stable compound, not
prone to oxidize, and, further, that the change of colour from
black to yellow has no reference to a modification of this salt.
The truth appears to be that the image whilst in the black stage
contains other elements besides Sulphur and Silver, but when it
has become yellow by the continued action of the sulphuretting
compound, it is then a true Sulphuret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Comparative permanence of Photographs under the action of
Sulphur.</i>&mdash;<i>Developed</i> Positives, as a rule, stand better than
those printed by direct exposure to light; but much depends upon
the nature of the negative process followed; and hence no general
statement can be made which will not be liable to many exceptions.
The mode of conducting the development must not be
overlooked. The prints, which become very red in the Hyposulphite
fixing Bath from the action of the developer having
been stopped at too early a period, are often sulphuretted and
destroyed even more readily than a vigorous sun-print obtained
by direct exposure to light.</p>

<p>A point of even greater importance is <i>the nature of the sensitive
surface</i> which receives the latent image. It is the print
<i>developed upon Iodide of Silver</i> which especially resists sulphuration.
In that case, not only is the preliminary toning effect
of the Sulphur more slow than usual, but the impression cannot
be made to fade by any continuance of the action. It loses much
of its brilliancy, and is reduced in intensity, but it is not so completely
destroyed as to be useless. The reason of this, as shown
in the last paper, depends upon the fact that the Talbotype proofs
contain the largest amount of Silver in the image.</p>

<p>The employment of Gold in toning does not render an ordinary
sun-print as permanent as a Positive developed upon Iodide
of Silver. The deep shadows of the picture are protected by the
Gold, but the lighter shades not so perfectly. Hence after the
Sulphur has acted, in place of the universal yellow and faded
aspect presented by the simple untoned print, the Positive fully
toned by Gold has black shadows with yellow half-tones. Therefore,
whilst recommending the use of Gold as a toning agent, it
does not seem advisable to lay too much stress upon it as a preservative
from the destructive action of Sulphur.</p>

<p><i>Exposure of Positive Prints to a Sulphuretting Atmosphere.</i>&mdash;In
testing the action of a solution of Sulphuretted Hydrogen
upon paper Positives, it did not appear that the conditions
under which the prints were placed bore a sufficiently close resemblance
to the case of Positives exposed to an atmosphere
contaminated with <i>minute traces</i> of the gas; and this more particularly
because it is known that <i>dry</i> Sulphuretted Hydrogen
has comparatively little effect upon Photographic Prints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The experiments were therefore repeated in a somewhat different
form. A number of Positives (about three dozen) printed
in various ways, were suspended in a glass case, measuring 2&frac12;
feet by 21 inches, and containing 7&frac12; cubic feet of air; into which
was introduced, occasionally, a few bubbles of Sulphuretted Hydrogen,
just sufficient to keep the air of the chamber smelling
perceptibly of the gas. A polished Daguerreotype plate was hung
up in the centre, to serve as a guide to the progress of the sulphuretting
action.</p>

<p>By the second day the metal plate had acquired a faint yellow
hue, not easily seen except in certain positions; but the Positives
were unaffected. At the expiration of three days the majority
of the pictures exhibited no signs of change, but a few untoned
prints of a pale red colour, some of which had been printed
by development, and others by direct exposure to light, had perceptibly
darkened.</p>

<p>After the eighth day, the action, appearing to progress more
slowly than at first, was stopped, and the prints removed. The
general results obtained were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Daguerreotype plate had become strongly tarnished with
a film of Sulphuret of Silver, which appeared yellowish-brown
in some parts and steel-blue in others. The Positives were, as
a rule, toned to a slightly colder shade, but many of them had
scarcely changed.</p>

<p>No obvious difference was observed between prints developed
on paper prepared with Chloride of Silver, and others printed by
direct exposure to light; but in all cases the prints obtained by
those methods which give a very red image after fixing, were the
first to show the change of colour due to sulphuration, the proofs
submitted to the test having all been previously toned with Gold.</p>

<p>Effect of Oxidizing Agents upon Positive Prints.&mdash;It appeared
of importance to ascertain to what extent Photographic Prints
are susceptible of oxidation; on account of the atmospheric influences
to which they are necessarily exposed. In experimenting
upon this subject the following results have been obtained.</p>

<p>Powerful oxidizers destroy Positive Prints rapidly; the action
usually commencing at the corners and edges of the paper, or
at any isolated point, such as a metallic speck or particle of extraneous
matter, which can serve as a centre of chemical action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
This same fact is often noticed in the fading of Positives by
long keeping, and therefore since other destructive actions (with
the exception of that of Chlorine) do not appear to follow the
same rule, it is an argument in addition to others which can be
adduced, that Photographic Prints are frequently destroyed by
oxidation.</p>

<p>Air which has been <i>Ozonized</i> by Phosphorus, and in which
blue litmus-paper becomes reddened, quickly bleaches the Positive
image. Oxygen gas, obtained by voltaic decomposition of
acidified water and which should contain Ozone, did not appear
to have an equal amount of effect, the action being comparatively
slight, or altogether wanting.</p>

<p><i>Peroxide of Hydrogen</i> obtained in solution, and in conjunction
with Acetate of Baryta, by adding Peroxide of Barium to dilute
Acetic Acid,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> bleaches darkened Positive paper; but the effect is
slow, and does not take place to a very perceptible extent if the
liquid be kept alkaline to test-paper.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Hydrochloric Acid, which is usually recommended in place of Acetic
Acid, cannot be employed in this experiment; it seems to cause a liberation
of free Chlorine, which bleaches the print instantly.</p></div>

<p>Nitric Acid applied in a concentrated form acts immediately
upon the darkened surface, bleaching every part of the print with
the exception of the bronzed shadows, which usually retain a
slight residual colour. A solution of Chromic Acid is still more
active. This liquid may usefully be applied to distinguish prints
toned by Sulphur from others toned by Gold; the presence of
metallic Gold protecting the shadows of the picture in some
measure from the action of the acid. The solution should be
prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Bichromate of Potash</td>
  <td class="tdr">6</td>
  <td class="tdl">grains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Strong Sulphuric Acid</td>
  <td class="tdr">4</td>
  <td class="tdl">minims.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Water</td>
  <td class="tdr">12</td>
  <td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A solution of Permanganate of Potash is an energetic destroyer
of paper positives; and, as it is a neutral substance, may conveniently
be employed in testing the relative capability of withstanding
oxidation possessed by different Photographic Prints. The
solution should be dilute, of a pale pink hue, and the Positives
must be moved occasionally, as the first effect is to decolorize a
great portion of the liquid, the Permanganate oxidizing the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and organic tissue of the paper. After an immersion of twenty
minutes to half an hour, varying with the degree of dilution, the
half-tones of the picture begin to die out, and the full shadows
become darker in colour; the bronzed portions of the print withstand
the action longer, but at length the whole is changed to a
yellow image much resembling in appearance the Photograph
faded by Sulphur.</p>

<p><i>Comparative permanence of Photographs treated with Permanganate
of Potash.</i>&mdash;Developed prints prepared by a Negative
process withstand the action better than others. But to this rule
there are exceptions; much depending upon the time of exposure
to light, and the extent to which the development is carried.
Those prints which, being exposed for a short time, and afterwards
strongly developed, become dark in colour and vigorous in
outline, are more permanent than others which having been over-exposed
and under-developed, lose their dark colour and become
red and comparatively faint in the Hyposulphite fixing Bath.</p>

<p>Positives developed upon a surface of <i>Chloride</i> of Silver on
plain paper do not resist the oxidizing action so perfectly as
those on Iodide of Silver. Prints developed upon paper prepared
with Serum of Milk containing Caseine stand better than
those on plain paper.</p>

<p>Of prints obtained by the ordinary process of direct exposure
to light, those on plain paper are the first to fade, the oxidizing
action being most seen upon the <i>half-tones</i>. The use of <i>Albumen</i>
gives a great advantage. Developed prints on Albumen stand
far better than the same upon plain paper; and even the Albuminized
sun prints are less injured by the Permanganate than
the best of the Negative prints prepared without Albumen. Caseine
has the same effect, but to a less extent; and as Serum of
Milk almost invariably contains uncoagulated Caseine, its efficacy
is thus explained.</p>

<p>The manner of toning the print is a point of importance; previous
sulphuration in an old Hyposulphite Bath always facilitating
the oxidizing action.</p>

<p><i>Action of Chlorine upon Positive Prints.</i>&mdash;Aqueous solution
of Chlorine destroys the Photographic image, changing it first to
a violet tint (probably Subchloride), and subsequently obliterating
it by conversion into white Chloride of Silver. The impression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
although invisible, remains in the paper, and may be developed
in the form of yellow or brown Sulphuret of Silver by the action
of Sulphuretted Hydrogen. It also becomes visible on exposure
to light, and assumes considerable intensity if the paper be previously
brushed with free Nitrate of Silver. Sulphate of Iron
produces no effect upon the invisible image of Chloride of Silver;
but Gallic or Pyrogallic Acid, rendered alkaline by Potash, converts
it into a black deposit.</p>

<p>The Action of Chlorine water usually commences at the edges
and corners of the print, in the same manner as that of oxidizing
agents. The proofs upon Albumen are the least readily injured,
and next, those developed on Iodide of Silver.</p>

<p><i>Hydrochloric Acid.</i>&mdash;The liquid acid of sp. gr. ·116, even when
free from Chlorine, acts immediately upon the half-tones of a positive
print, and destroys the full shadows in the course of a few
hours; a slight residual colour however usually remains in the
darkest parts. The prints developed on Iodide of Silver are the
most permanent.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuric, Acetic Acids, etc.</i>&mdash;Acids of all kinds appear to
exert an injurious influence upon Positive prints, and especially
so upon the half-tones of the image, the effect varying with the
strength of the acid and the degree of dilution with water. Even
a vegetable acid like Acetic gradually darkens the colour and destroys
partially or entirely the faint outlines of the picture.</p>

<p><i>Bichloride of Mercury.</i>&mdash;The most important particulars relating
to the action of this test upon Photographs are well known.
The image is ultimately converted into a white powder, and
hence, in the case of a Positive print, it becomes invisible; immersion
in Ammonia or Hyposulphite of Soda however restores
it in a form often resembling in tint the original impression.
A point worthy of note is the protective effect of a deposit of
Gold, which is very marked, the proof, after toning, resisting the
action of the Bichloride for comparatively a long time.</p>

<p><i>Ammonia.</i>&mdash;The effect of Ammonia upon a print is rather to
<i>redden</i> the image than to destroy it; the half-tones become pale
and faint, but they do not disappear. Toning with Gold enables
the proof to resist the action of the strongest solution of
Ammonia, and hence Ammonia may safely be employed as a
fixing agent after the use of the Sel d'or Bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hyposulphite of Soda.</i>&mdash;A concentrated solution of Hyposulphite
of Soda exercises a gradual solvent action upon the image
of Photographic Prints, at the same time tending to communicate
Sulphur and to darken the colour of the impression. A faint
yellow outline of Sulphuret of Silver usually remains after the
solution of the image is completed.</p>

<p>Developed prints of all kinds, but in particular the Talbotype
proofs upon Iodide of Silver, are less readily dissolved by Hyposulphite
of Soda than those obtained by the direct action of light.
There is also a slight difference between plain and Albuminized
prints, which is in favour of the former, the albuminized paper
always losing somewhat more by immersion in the Hyposulphite
Bath than plain Chloride paper sensitized by Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p><i>Cyanide of Potassium.</i>&mdash;The solvent action of Cyanide of Potassium
is most energetic upon Photographs formed on paper.
These images, whether developed or not, do not withstand the
test so well as the impressions on Collodion. Albuminized proofs
are also somewhat more easily affected than prints on simple
Chloride paper sensitized with Nitrate or Ammonio-Nitrate of
Silver.</p>

<p><i>Heat, moist and dry.</i>&mdash;Long-continued boiling in distilled
water has a reddening action upon Positive Prints. The image
becomes at length pale and faint, resembling a print treated
with Ammonia before toning. A deposit of Gold upon the image
lessens, but does not altogether neutralize, the effect of the hot
water. If the boiling be long continued, the violet-purple tone
often imparted by the Gold invariably gives place to a chocolate-brown,
which appears to be the most permanent colour. Prints
<i>developed</i> by Gallic Acid upon paper prepared with Serum of
Milk or with a Citrate, suffer as much as others obtained by direct
action of light. Ammonio-Nitrate prints on highly salted
paper, which become nearly black when toned with Gold, retain
their original appearance the most perfectly; a slight diminution
of brightness being the only observable difference after long boiling
in water. Albumen proofs, and prints on English papers, or
foreign papers prepared with Serum of Milk, Citrates, Tartrates,
or any of those bodies which <i>redden</i> the reduced Salt, are, as a
rule, rendered lighter in colour, and pass from purple to brown
when boiled in water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Dry heat has an opposite effect to that of hot water, usually
<i>darkening</i> the colour of the image. On exposing a plain paper
print simply fixed, and thoroughly freed from Hyposulphite of
Soda by washing, to a current of heated air, it changes gradually
from red to dark brown, in which state it continues until the
temperature rises to the point at which the paper begins to char,
when it resumes its original red tone, becoming at the same time
faint and indistinct.</p>

<p><i>The Products of Combustion of Coal-gas a cause of Fading.</i>&mdash;Coal-gas
contains Sulphur compounds, which in combustion are
oxidized into Sulphurous and Sulphuric Acids; other substances
of a deleterious nature may also be present. A plate of polished
silver suspended in a glass tube, through which was directed the
current of heated air rising from a small gas jet, became tarnished
with a white film in the course of twenty-four hours. Positive
prints exposed to the same, absorbed moisture and faded; the
action resembling that of oxidation, in being preceded by a general
darkening in colour. Of four prints exposed, an Iodide-developed
print was the least injured, and next, a print upon
Albuminized paper.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ON THE ACTION OF DAMP AIR UPON POSITIVE PRINTS.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain this point, more than six dozen Positives,
printed on every variety of paper, were mounted in new and
perfectly clean stoppered glass bottles, at the bottom of each of
which was placed a little distilled water, to keep the contained
air always moist. They were removed at the expiration of three
months, having been kept during that time, some in the dark,
and others exposed to the light. As the prints were prepared
by various methods, toned in different ways, and mounted with
or without substances likely to exercise a deleterious action, this
series of experiments will possess considerable value in determining
some of the intrinsic causes of fading of Positives.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> For a more detailed account of the experiments, see the original paper
in the 'Photographic Journal,' vol. iii.</p></div>

<p>The general results obtained were as follows:&mdash;Positives which
had been <i>simply fixed</i> in Hyposulphite of Soda remained quite
uninjured. Whether developed by Gallic Acid on either of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
three Salts of Silver usually employed, or printed by direct action
of light, the result was the same. Hence we may infer that the
darkened material which forms the image of Photographic Prints
does not readily oxidize in a damp atmosphere.</p>

<p><i>Toned</i> Positives were found in many cases to be less permanent
than Positives simply fixed. This was especially the case when
the toning had been effected by <i>Sulphur</i>; all the sulphuretted
prints, fixed in solution of Hyposulphite which had been long
used, became yellow in the half-tones when exposed to moisture.
Positives fixed and toned in Hyposulphite containing Gold were
variously affected; some prepared when the solution was in an
active state being unchanged, others losing a little half-tone, and
others, again, fading badly. These latter were prepared in a
Bath which had lost Gold and acquired sulphuretting properties;
and it was noticed that they were more injured by the action of
boiling water than those Positives which proved to be permanent
under the influence of the moisture.</p>

<p>Toning by means of Chloride of Gold appeared to be highly
satisfactory, but the number of prints operated upon was small.
The Sel d'or process also did not injure the integrity of the
image, no commencing yellowness or bleaching of half-tones
being visible after exposure to the moist air.</p>

<p>This series of experiments confirmed the statement made in a
former paper, that some tints obtained in Positive printing are
more permanent than others. Violet tones produced by Sulphur
invariably passed into a dull brown by the action of the moist
air; and even when Gold was employed in toning, these same
purple colours were usually <i>reddened</i>. This was especially the
case when English papers were used, or foreign papers re-sized
with Serum of Milk containing Caseine. The chocolate-brown
tints which best stand the action of boiling water, and in particular
those upon Ammonio-Nitrate paper, were least affected
by the damp air; and indeed it was evident that the two agents,
viz. moist air and hot water, acted alike in tending to <i>redden</i>
the print, although the latter did so in the most marked manner.</p>

<p>It seemed also, from the results of these experiments, to be a
point of great importance that the size should be removed from
the print in order to render it indestructible by damp air. This
was evidently seen in two cases where Positives, toned in an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Hyposulphite and Gold Bath, were divided into halves, one of
which was treated with a strong solution of Ammonia. The result
was that the halves in which the size was allowed to remain,
faded, whilst the others were comparatively uninjured. The Albumen
proofs especially suffered when the size was left in the
paper, a destructive mouldiness forming, and fading the picture.
The use of boiling water obviated this, and the prints so treated
remained clean and bright. A partial decomposition of Albumen
however occurred in some cases even when hot water was used,
the gloss disappearing from the paper in isolated patches. With
<i>Caseine</i> substituted for Albumen there was also a loss of half-tone;
thus seeming to indicate that both these animal principles,
although stable under ordinary conditions, will, even when coagulated
by Nitrate of Silver, decompose if kept long in a moist
state.</p>

<p>The use of improper substances for mounting proved to be
another determining cause of fading by oxidation. Those bodies
which combine with Oxide of Silver, are likely upon theoretical
grounds to destroy the half-tones of the image; and it was found,
that if the picture were left in contact with Alum, Acetic Acid,
etc., or with the substances which generate an acid by fermentation,
such as paste or starch, it invariably faded.</p>

<p>The supposed accelerating influence of <i>Light</i> upon the fading
of Positives was not confirmed by these experiments, as far as
they extended. Many of the bottles containing the Photographs
were placed outside the window of a house with a southern
aspect during the whole of the three months with the exception
of two or three weeks, but no difference whatever could be detected
between Positives so treated and others kept in total darkness.
It will be proper however that this part of the investigation
should be repeated, allowing a longer time.</p>

<p>An examination of the various modes employed for coating
Positives, in order to exclude the atmosphere, showed that many
of them were not fitted to fulfil the purpose intended. Waxed
prints faded quite as much when exposed to moisture as others not
waxed. White wax is a substance often adulterated, and Oil of
Turpentine has been shown to contain a body resembling Ozone
in properties, and possessing the power of bleaching a dilute
solution of Sulphate of Indigo. Spirit varnish applied to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
surface of the picture after re-sizing with Gelatine was plainly
superior to white wax, but nevertheless it did not obviate the
fading effect of the moisture upon an unstable Positive which had
been toned by sulphuration. Its protective influence is therefore
limited.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ON THE CHANGE IN COMPOSITION WHICH HYPOSULPHITE
OF SODA EXPERIENCES BY USE IN FIXING PAPER PROOFS.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> These observations are condensed and re-arranged from the papers
published by the Author in the 'Photographic Journal' for September and
October, 1854.</p></div>

<p>It was remarked by Photographers at an early period that the
properties of the Fixing Bath of Hyposulphite of Soda became
altered by constant use; that it gradually acquired the power of
<i>darkening</i> the colour of the Positive image. This change was at
first referred to the accumulation of <i>Salts of Silver</i> in the Bath,
and hence directions were given to dissolve a portion of blackened
Chloride of Silver in the Hyposulphite in preparing a new
solution.</p>

<p>Careful experiments performed by the Author convinced him
that an error had been entertained; since it was found that the
simple solution of Chloride of Silver in Hyposulphite of Soda had
no power of yielding the black tones. But it afterwards appeared
that if the fixing Bath, containing dissolved Silver Salts, were set
aside for a few weeks, a <i>decomposition</i> occurred in it, evidenced
by the formation of a black deposit of Sulphuret of Silver; and
<i>then</i> it became active in toning the proofs.</p>

<p>The presence of this deposit of Sulphuret of Silver indicated
that a portion of Hyposulphite of Silver had spontaneously decomposed,
and, knowing the products which are generated by the
spontaneous decomposition of this salt, a clue to the difficulty
was afforded. One atom of Hyposulphite of Silver includes the
elements of one of Sulphuret of Silver and one of Sulphuric Acid.
Sulphuric Acid in contact with Hyposulphite of Soda produces
<i>Sulphurous Acid</i> by a process of displacement; and Plessy has
shown that Sulphurous Acid reacts upon an excess of Hyposulphite
of Soda, forming two of that interesting series of Sulphur
compounds designated by Berzelius the "Polythionic Acids."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>It appeared therefore probable, upon theoretical grounds, that
the Penta-, Tetra-, and Trithionates might produce some effect
in the Hyposulphite fixing Bath. Upon making the trial these
expectations were verified; and it was found that Tetrathionate
of Soda added to Hyposulphite of Soda yielded a fixing and
toning Bath quite equal in activity to that produced by means of
Chloride of Gold.</p>

<p>It may be useful to review for an instant the composition of
the Polythionic series of acids; it is thus represented:&mdash;</p>

<p>The amount of <i>Oxygen</i> in all is the same, that of the other element
increases progressively; hence it is at once evident that the
highest member of the series might <i>by losing Sulphur</i> descend
gradually until it reached the condition of the lowest.</p>

<p>This transition is not only theoretically possible, but there is an
actual tendency to it, all the acids being unstable with the exception
of the Hyposulphuric. The Alkaline Salts of these acids are
more unstable than the acids themselves; a solution of Tetrathionate
of Soda becomes milky in the course of a few days from
deposition of Sulphur, and, if tested, is then found to contain
<i>Tri</i>thionate and eventually <i>Di</i>thionate of Soda.</p>

<p>The cause of the change in properties of the fixing Bath being
thus clearly traced to a decomposition of Hyposulphite of Silver,
and a consequent generation of unstable principles capable of imparting
Sulphur to the immersed proofs, it seemed desirable to
continue the experiments.&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a peculiar <i>acid condition</i> commonly assumed by old
fixing Baths, which could not be satisfactorily explained, since it
was known that acids do not exist long in a free state in solution
of Hyposulphite of Soda, but tend to neutralize themselves by displacing
<i>Hyposulphurous Acid</i> spontaneously decomposable into
Sulphurous Acid and Sulphur. This point is set at rest by the
discovery of a peculiar reaction which takes place between certain
salts of the Polythionic acids and Hyposulphite of Soda. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
solution of Tetrathionate of Soda may be preserved for many hours
unchanged; but if a few crystals of Hyposulphite of Soda be
dropped in, it begins very shortly to deposit Sulphur, and continues
to do so for several days. At the same time the liquid
acquires an acid reaction to test-paper, and produces effervescence
on the addition of Carbonate of Lime.</p>

<p>It is evident that a Sulphur acid exists which has not hitherto
been described, and that this acid is formed as one of the products
of the decomposition of the Hyposulphite of Silver contained in
the fixing Bath. The subject is an important one to Photographers,
because it is found that Hyposulphite Baths which
have acquired the acid reaction, although toning quickly, yield
Positives which fade on keeping. The acid may perhaps combine
with the reduced Silver Salt, which, if the image be allowed to
contain Suboxide of Silver, is theoretically probable.</p>

<p>The experiments were next directed towards ascertaining more
carefully the effect of the acid fixing Bath upon the Positive
proofs. Tetrathionate of Soda added to solution of Hyposulphite
of Soda produces, at the expiration of twelve hours, a
liquid which, when filtered from the deposited Sulphur, reddens
blue litmus-paper slowly. Positive prints immersed in the Bath
pass from red to black, dissolving in the half-tones, and becoming
yellow and faded if the action be too long continued. On
adding Carbonate of Soda in quantity sufficient to remove the
acid reaction, the power of toning is much diminished, but dark
colours can still be obtained by continuing the action. The solvent
effect upon the half-tones, evidently caused in great measure by
the acid, is lessened; whilst the tendency to yellowness in the
white parts of the proof, almost disappears. These effects are
more particularly manifested when the prints are immersed in
the Bath immediately on their removal from the printing frame;
and it is found almost impossible to preserve the whites of the
impression clear, in the acid Bath, unless the Nitrate of Silver
has been washed away.</p>

<p>Solution of half-tones and yellowness in the lights, both a
source of annoyance to the operator, are thus traced in great
measure to an acid condition of the fixing and toning Bath;
and the remedy is obvious.</p>

<p>The Author's experiments upon the Tetrathionates and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
reaction with Hyposulphite of Soda likewise elicited the important
fact that <i>alkalies</i> decompose the unstable sulphuretted principle.
If the Bath be treated with Potash or Carbonate of Soda, an alkaline
<i>Sulphuret</i> appears to be gradually formed, which precipitates
Sulphuret of Silver, and in the course of a few days the liquid returns
to its original condition and ceases to act as a toning agent
upon the proof. The same effect takes place to a great extent
when the solution is set aside for several weeks or months; a process
of spontaneous change going forward, which issues in a deposition
of Sulphur and Sulphuret of Silver, and a partial loss of
sulphuretting properties in the liquid.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to the scientific investigator to describe
the mode of preparing a fixing and toning Bath, illustrating the
above remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>dissolve this likewise in 2 ounces of water, and the remainder of
the Hyposulphite in the other 4 ounces. Then, having the three
solutions in separate vessels, pour the Nitrate of Silver at once into
the 2-ounce solution of Hyposulphite, agitating the precipitated
Hyposulphite of Silver rapidly. In a short time it will begin to
decompose, passing from white to canary-yellow, and then to
orange-yellow. <i>When the orange-yellow begins to verge towards
brown</i>, add the 4-ounce concentrated solution of Hyposulphite,
which will at once complete the decomposition, a part of the
precipitate dissolving and the remainder becoming perfectly black.
After filtering out the black Sulphuret of Silver, the solution is
ready for use.</p>

<p>A Bath prepared by this formula is not usually very active, but
it shows clearly the process by which an ordinary fixing Bath may
be converted into a toning Bath by the immersion of positives
having free Nitrate of Silver upon the surface.</p>

<p>The following formula is more economical and gives a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
result, but it cannot be used for "Ammonio-Nitrate" prints; the

strikes a fine purple colour, but this soon disappears. When
the liquid has become again colourless, which it does in a few
minutes, add the Nitrate of Silver, stirring briskly. Perfect solution
will take place without any formation of black Sulphuret.</p>

<p>A toning Bath prepared with Chloride of Iron will be ready
for use twelve hours after mixing, but it will be more active at
the expiration of a week. The solution is acid to test-paper,

of Iron with Hydrochloric Acid, in preference to dissolving
Iron wire in Aqua-Regia.</p>

<p>The addition of the Nitrate of Silver is made in order to produce
a portion of Hyposulphite of Silver in the bath; the presence
of a Silver Salt having been found to modify the tint of the
Positives, and to prevent their quickly turning yellow.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION IV.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On the Fading of Photographic Prints.</i></p>

<p>For many years subsequent to the discovery of the process
of Photographic Printing by Mr. Fox Talbot, it was
not generally known that pictures so produced were easily
susceptible of injury from various causes, and in particular
from traces of the <i>fixing-agent</i> remaining in the paper.
Hence, due care not being taken in the proper cleansing
and preservation of the proofs, the majority of them faded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>This matter became at last one of such importance that
the Council of the Photographic Society decided upon
forming a Committee for the purpose of examining the subject.
The Author was honoured by being placed upon
this Committee, and the researches of which an abstract
has been given in the previous Section, were undertaken
at the request of the Society.</p>

<p>The present Section is intended to explain practically
and in a concise manner the causes of the fading of Photographic
Prints, and the precautions which should be taken
to ensure their permanency. The chemistry of the subject
having been fully explained in the last Section, it will
suffice to refer the reader to its pages for more detailed information.</p>

<p><i>Historical evidence of the permanence of Photographs.</i>&mdash;It
is a point of interest to collect information as to the
existence of old Photographs which have remained many
years unchanged. There are numerous instances of Positives
printed more than ten years ago, which have not perceptibly
altered up to the present time. These prints are
mostly on plain paper, Albumen not having come into use
at so early a date. The general impression of practical
operators however is, that fading has occurred less frequently
since the introduction of Albuminized paper.</p>

<p>Positives printed by development on paper prepared by
Talbot's method seem as a rule to have stood remarkably
well, and instances of Talbotype Negatives having faded
are rare.</p>

<p>Of the prints which have proved to be permanent, some
are red or brown in colour, but many, being of a dark or
purple shade, have evidently been toned, although not with
Gold, the use of which was unknown to the earlier Photographers.</p>

<p>It is plain from data thus collected, that Photographs
do not necessarily fade by time; and the fact that in one
and the same portfolio are constantly seen prints which
appear permanent, and others in an advanced state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
change, cannot but lead to the inference that the main
causes of deterioration are intrinsic, depending upon some
injurious matters left in the paper; which is confirmed
by experiment.</p>

<p><i>Causes of fading.</i>&mdash;The Author believes that the fading
of Photographic Prints may almost invariably be referred
to one or other of the following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>a. <i>Imperfect washing.</i>&mdash;This is perhaps the most important
of all, and the most frequent. When Hyposulphite
of Soda is allowed to remain in the paper, even in minute
quantity, it gradually decomposes, with liberation of Sulphur,
and destroys the print in the same way and quite as
effectually as a solution of Sulphuretted Hydrogen or an
alkaline sulphuret.</p>

<p>Imperfect washing may be suspected, if the Photograph,
within a few months from the date of its preparation, <i>begins
to get darker in colour</i>: the <i>half-tints</i>, which are the
first to show the action, afterwards passing into the yellow
stage, whilst the dark shadows remain black or brown for
a longer time.</p>

<p>The proper mode of washing Photographs is sometimes
misunderstood. The length of time during which the print
lies in the water is a point of less importance, than that the
water should be continually changed. When a number of
Positives are placed together in a pan, and a tap turned
upon them, the circulation of fluid does not necessarily extend
to the bottom. This is proved by the addition of a
little colouring matter, which shows that the stream flows
actively above, but at the lower part of the vessel, and
between the prints, there is a stationary layer of water
which is of little use in washing out the Hyposulphite.
Care should therefore be taken that the pictures are kept
as far as possible separate from each other, and when running
water cannot be had, that they are frequently moved
and turned over, fresh water being constantly added.
When this is done, and especially if the <i>size</i> be removed
from the paper in the manner presently to be advised, <i>four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
or five hours</i> washing will be sufficient. It is a mistake to
allow the pictures to remain in the water for several days;
which produces no good effect, and may tend to encourage
a putrefactive fermentation, or the formation of a white
deposit upon the image when the water contains Carbonate
of Lime.</p>

<p>b. <i>Acid matters left in the Paper.</i>&mdash;Upon examining
collections of old Photographs, it is not uncommon to find
prints which are stated to have remained unaltered for a
long time after their first production, but in the course of
time to have lost their brilliancy, and become pale and indistinct.
This kind of fading often commences at the corners
and edges of the paper, and works inwards towards
the centre. The Author's experiments have shown that it
is principally caused by a slow process of <i>oxidation</i>.</p>

<p>The Photographic Image does not appear readily susceptible
of oxidation unless it be previously darkened by the
action of Sulphur, or placed in contact with acids or bodies
which act as solvents of Oxide of Silver (<a href="#Page_146">p. 146</a>). The
materials often used in sizing papers, such as Alum and
Resin, being of an acid nature, are directly injurious to the
image; and the removal of the size, which may easily be
effected by means of a dilute alkali or an alkaline carbonate,
without injury to the tint, has the additional advantage
of carrying out the last traces of Hyposulphite of
Soda, and also the germs of <i>fungi</i>, which if allowed to remain
would vegetate and produce a destructive mouldiness
on exposure to damp (Chap. III. Part II.).</p>

<p>The fact that acids facilitate oxidation of the image is
likewise a hint that Photographic Prints should not be
handled too frequently, or touched with the finger more
than is necessary; the warm hand may leave behind a trace
of acid<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which would tend in time to produce a yellow
mark.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The writer has seen blue litmus-paper immediately reddened by being
laid upon the arm of a person suffering from acute Rheumatism. This acid
is probably Lactic Acid!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p></div>

<p>c. <i>Moisture as a cause of fading.</i>&mdash;Although. Photographs
properly printed are not readily injured by damp
air (<a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>), yet as there are <i>impurities</i> of various kinds
constantly floating in the atmosphere, a state of comparative
dryness may be said to be essential to the preservation of
all Photographs. In collecting evidence upon the subject,
"wet" and "damp" are frequently alleged as having been
causes of fading&mdash;the prints were hung against a damp
wall during frosty weather, in a room without a fire: or
the rain had been allowed to penetrate the frame! No
pictures will long survive such treatment, and Photographs,
like engravings and water-colour paintings, require common
care to be exercised in their preservation.</p>

<p>d. <i>The modes of Mounting the Proof.</i>&mdash;This subject has
been alluded to in the abstract of the Author's papers at
<a href="#Page_155">p. 155</a>. All cements which are of an acid nature, or which
are liable to become <i>sour</i> by acetous fermentation, should
be avoided. Flour paste is especially injurious, and many
cases of fading have been traced to this cause. The addition
of Bichloride of Mercury, which is often made to prevent
the paste from becoming mouldy, would still more
unfit it for Photographic use (<a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>). Starch is not much
preferable. No substance appears better than Gelatine,
which does not readily decompose, and shows no tendency
to absorb atmospheric moisture. The <i>deliquescent</i> nature
of many bodies is a point which should be borne in mind
in mounting Photographs, and hence the use of a salt
like <i>Carbonate of Potash</i>, which the writer has known
to be added to paste to prevent the formation of acid,
would be unadvisable.</p>

<p>e. <i>The effect of Imperfect Fixation.</i>&mdash;The earlier Photographers
did not always succeed in properly fixing their
prints, since old Photographs are often found thickly
studded with spots and blotches in the tissue of the paper.
These prints however are not invariably faded upon the
surface, and hence it cannot be said that imperfect fixation
will certainly end in the total destruction of the picture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Still a notice of the subject may properly be introduced in
this place, and the attention of the reader be once more
drawn to the importance of washing the print in water on
removing it from the printing frame; a decomposition
invariably occurring when paper Positives <i>saturated with
free Nitrate of Silver</i> are plunged in a dilute solution of
Hyposulphite of Soda, containing an insufficient quantity
of the salt to dissolve away the Hyposulphite of Silver
before it begins to undergo spontaneous change.</p>

<p>f. <i>Exposure to an impure Atmosphere as a cause of
Fading.</i>&mdash;The five causes of fading which precede, have
mostly reference to an intrinsically faulty condition of the
print. This, the sixth, explains the mode in which a Photograph
carefully prepared may yet suffer injury from deleterious
matters often present in the atmosphere. The
air of large cities, and particularly that emanating from
sewers and drains, contains Sulphuretted Hydrogen, and
hence articles of silver-plate become tarnished unless placed
beneath glass. The injury which a print sustains by exposure
to air contaminated with Sulphuretted Hydrogen, is
less than the tarnish produced upon the bright surface of
a silver plate (see <a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>); but it is recommended as a precautionary
measure, that Photographic Pictures be protected
by glass or kept in a portfolio, and that they be not
exposed too freely to the air.</p>

<p>The products of the combustion of coal-gas are probably
more likely than the cause last named, to be a source of
injury to Photographs suspended without any covering.
The sulphur compounds in gas burn into Sulphurous and
Sulphuric Acids, the latter of which, in combination with
Ammonia, produces the sparkling crystals often observed
upon the shop windows.</p>

<p>The question as to the manner in which the Photographic
Image may best be protected from these extraneous causes
of fading has been mooted, and many plans of coating
prints with some impervious material have been devised.
If the pictures are to be glazed or kept in a portfolio, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of itself will be sufficient, but in other cases it may perhaps
be useful to apply a layer of spirit or gutta-percha varnish.
The use of wax, resin, and such bodies is likely, by introducing
impurities, to act injuriously rather than otherwise.</p>

<p>g. <i>Decomposition of Pyroxyline a source of Injury to
Collodion Photographs.</i>&mdash;Collodion Positives and Negatives
are usually esteemed permanent; but some have been
exhibited which, having been put away in a damp place,
gradually became pale and indistinct. The change commences
at rough edges and isolated points, leaving the
centre, as a rule, the last affected. On examination, numerous
cracks are often visible, thus seeming to indicate
that the Collodion film has undergone decomposition. The
result of this would be the liberation of corrosive Oxides
of Nitrogen, which destroy the image. Substitution compounds
containing Peroxide of Nitrogen are known to be
liable to spontaneous change. The bitter resin produced
by acting upon white sugar with Nitro-Sulphuric Acid, if
not kept perfectly dry, will sometimes evolve enough gas
to destroy the cork of the bottle in which it is kept; the
solution of the resin has then a strong acid reaction, and
rapidly fades an ordinary Positive Print.</p>

<p>These facts are interesting, and indicate that Collodion
Pictures, containing in themselves the elements of their
destruction, should be protected from moisture by a coating
of varnish.</p>

<p><i>Comparative Permanence of Photographic Prints.</i>&mdash;There
is every reason to think that the Photographic
Image, however formed, is permanent, if certain injurious
conditions are avoided;&mdash;in other words, that prints do
not necessarily fade, in the same manner as fugitive colours,
by a simple exposure to light and air. But supposing a
case, which is the common one, of injurious influences
which cannot altogether be removed, it may be useful to
inquire what mode of printing gives the greatest amount
of stability.</p>

<p>Positives produced by a short exposure to light and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
subsequent development with Gallic Acid, may be expected
to be more permanent than ordinary sun-prints; not that
there is any reason to suppose the chemical composition
of a developed image to be peculiar, but that the use of the
Gallic Acid enables us to increase the intensity of the red
picture first formed, and to add to its stability by precipitating
fresh Silver upon it. This point has not always
been attended to. It has been recommended to remove the
print from the developing solution whilst in the <i>red</i> and
early stage of development, and to produce the dark tones
subsequently by means of gold; but this plan, although
giving very good results as regards colour and gradation
of tone, appears to lessen the advantage which would otherwise
accrue from the adoption of a Negative process, and
to leave the picture, as regards permanency, much in the
condition of an ordinary print obtained by direct action of
light.</p>

<p>The original Talbotype process, in which the latent image
is formed upon Iodide of Silver, produces, next to Collodion,
the most stable image; but the difficulty of obtaining
bright and warm tints on Iodide of Silver, will stand in
the way of its adoption.</p>

<p>The <i>toning</i> of Paper Positives is the part of the process
which is likely to injure their stability; inasmuch as the
finest results cannot easily be obtained without incurring
<i>sulphuration</i>, and the action of Sulphur, if carried to any
extent, has been shown to be detrimental. The point to be
kept in view, is to alter the original structure of the image
as little as possible in toning; and it is best to use Gold
in preference to Sulphur as the colouring agent. On theoretical
grounds, toning by an alkaline solution of Chloride
of Gold (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>), and fixing by Ammonia, is the best process;
but the employment of Sel d'or, which gives a more
agreeable colour and has not been found practically to injure
the image, will be generally preferred. In using <i>a
single fixing and toning Bath</i> the same object of working
by Gold rather than by Sulphur may be best attained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
maintaining the activity of the Bath by constant additions
of Chloride of Gold.</p>

<p>The prints which are <i>least stable</i> are such as have been
toned in <i>acid Hyposulphite Baths, without Gold;</i> and the
difficulty of preserving such pictures from becoming yellow
in the half-tones is very great. Possibly a portion of the Sulphuretted
Acid may unite with the Suboxide of Silver and
cannot be removed by washing (see <a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>); but even if this
be not the case, it is certain that no ordinary amount of care
will obviate the occasional occurrence of fading, unless the
Hyposulphite Bath be kept <i>neutral to test-paper</i>. And all
those plans of toning in which Acetic or Hydrochloric Acid
is mixed with Hyposulphite of Soda, and the Positive immersed
whilst the liquid is in a milky state from precipitation
of Sulphur, ought studiously to be avoided.</p>

<p>It will be well also to avoid pushing the action of the
fixing and toning Bath to its utmost limits, since practice
and theory both teach us that the Positives which have
been long in the Hyposulphite, and consequently show a
tendency to yellowness in the light parts, are most liable
to lose their half-tones on keeping. Photographic Prints
are found often to <i>darken</i> slightly in the course of years;
and therefore by suspending the toning action at an earlier
stage a margin is left for what some have termed "an improvement
by time."</p>

<p>The use of <i>Albuminized</i> in preference to plain paper
gives an advantage in protecting the image from oxidation;
but if constantly exposed to moisture, a putrefactive decomposition
of the animal matter may occur. The proper
colour of the Albumen image being a <i>pale red</i>, the black
tones should not be sought for on that variety of paper:
their production, if Hyposulphite of Soda were used in
toning, would probably imply an amount of Sulphuration
which would more than counterbalance any advantage
otherwise derivable from the Albumen.</p>

<p>Permanent Positives of a black colour may easily be obtained
by sensitizing plain paper, free from animal matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
with Oxide of Silver in place of Nitrate. The simply fixed
image being in that case of a <i>sepia tint</i>, requires a less
amount of toning to change it to black. An impression was
at one time prevalent that Ammonio-Nitrate prints were
unstable; but so far from such being the case, they are
proved to withstand the action of all destructive tests
better than pictures prepared upon the same kind of paper
sensitized with plain Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p><i>Mode of testing the permanence of Positives.</i>&mdash;The tests
for Hyposulphite of Soda are not sufficiently delicate to
indicate with certainty when the process of washing has
been properly performed. The quantity of that salt left
in the paper is usually so small and so much mixed up
with organic matter, that the application of Protonitrate
of Mercury or of Nitrate of Silver to the liquid which
drains from the corner of the print, would probably mislead
the operator.</p>

<p>A dilute solution of Permanganate of Potash, prepared
by dissolving from half a grain or two grains of the salt,
according to its purity, in one gallon of distilled water,
affords a convenient mode of testing Positives as regards
their power of resisting oxidation; and to an experienced
eye it will prove the presence or absence of Hyposulphite
of Soda, the smallest trace of which is sufficient to remove
the pink colour of the Permanganate.</p>

<p>The most available and simple plan of testing permanence
is to enclose the pictures in a stoppered glass bottle
with a small quantity of water. If they retain their half-tones
after a course of three months of this treatment, and
do not become mouldy, the mode of printing followed is
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Boiling water will also be found useful in distinguishing
the unstable colours produced by Sulphur from those following
the judicious employment of Gold; in all cases the
image will at first be reddened by the hot water, but if
toned without Sulphur it will, as a rule, recover much of
its dark colour on drying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The characteristic appearance of prints which have been I
much sulphuretted in the toning Bath, and are very liable
to fade, should be known. A yellow colour in the lights
is a bad sign; and if the half-tones are at all faint and
indistinct, with an aspect of commencing yellowness, it is
almost certain that the Positive will not last for any considerable
length of time.</p>

<p class="caption3">ON THE THEORY OF THE DAGUERREOTYPE AND TALBOTYPE PROCESSES, ETC.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Daguerreotype.</i></p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not the original intention of the Author to include
a description of the Daguerreotype Process within the limits
of the present Work. The Daguerreotype is a branch
of the Photographic Art so distinct from the others, that,
in manipulatory details, it bears very little analogy to them;
a slight sketch of the theory of the process may not however
be unacceptable.</p>

<p>All necessary remarks will fall under three heads:&mdash;The
preparation of the Daguerreotype film;&mdash;the means
by which the latent image is developed;&mdash;and the strengthening
of the image by Hyposulphite of Gold.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation of the Daguerreotype Film.</i>&mdash;The
sensitive film of the Daguerreotypist is in many respects
different from that of the Calotype or Collodiotype. The
latter may be termed wet processes, in contradistinction
to the former, where aqueous solutions are not employed.
The Daguerreotype film is a pure and isolated Iodide
of Silver, formed by the direct action of Iodine upon the
metal. Hence it lacks one element of sensitiveness possessed
by the others, viz. the presence of soluble Nitrate
of Silver in contact with the particles of Iodide of Silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>It is important to remember that the Iodide of Silver
prepared by acting with vapour of Iodine upon metallic
Silver, is different in its Photographic action from the
yellow salt obtained by double decomposition between
Iodide of Potassium and Nitrate of Silver. A Daguerreotype
film, when exposed to a bright light, first darkens to
an ash-grey colour and then becomes nearly white; the
solubility in Hyposulphite of Soda being at the same time
lessened. A Collodion film, on the other hand, if the excess
of Nitrate of Silver be washed off, although it is still
capable of receiving the radiant impression in the Camera,
does not alter either in colour or in solubility, by exposure
even to the sun's rays.</p>

<p><i>Details of the process for preparing a Daguerreotype
Plate.</i>&mdash;A copper plate of moderate thickness is coated
upon the surface with a layer of pure Silver, either by the
electrotype or in any other convenient manner. It is then
polished with great care, until the surface assumes a brilliant
metallic lustre. This preliminary operation of polishing
is one of great practical importance, and the troublesome
details attending it constitute one of the main
difficulties to be overcome.</p>

<p>After the polishing is complete, the plate is ready to
receive the sensitive coating. This part of the process is
conducted in a peculiar manner. A simple piece of cardboard
or a thin sheet of wood, previously soaked in solution
of Iodine, evolves enough of the vapour to attack the
silver plate; which being placed immediately above, and
allowed to remain for a short time, acquires a pale violet
hue, due to the formation of <i>an excessively delicate layer</i>
of Iodide of Silver. By prolonging the action of the
Iodine the violet tint disappears and a variety of prismatic
colours are produced, much in the same way as when
light is decomposed by thin plates of mica or the surface
of mother-of-pearl. From violet the plate becomes of a
straw-yellow, then rose-colour, and afterwards steel-grey.
By continuing the exposure, the same sequence of tints is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
repeated; the steel-grey disappears, and the yellow and
rose-colours recur. The deposit of Iodide of Silver gradually
increases in thickness during these changes; but
to the end it remains excessively thin and delicate. In
this respect it contrasts strongly with the dense and
creamy layer often employed in the Collodion process, and
shows that a large proportion of the Iodide of Silver must
in such a case be superfluous, as far as any influence produced
by the light is concerned. An inspection of a sensitive
Daguerreotype plate reveals the microscopic nature
of the actinic changes involved in the Photographic Art,
and teaches a useful lesson.</p>

<p><i>Increase of sensibility obtained by combining the joint
action of Bromine and Iodine.</i>&mdash;The original process of
Daguerre was conducted with the vapour of Iodine only;
but in the year 1840 it was discovered by Mr. John Goddard
that the sensibility of the plate was greatly promoted
by exposing it to the vapours of Iodine and Bromine in
succession,&mdash;the proper time for each being regulated by
the tints assumed.</p>

<p>The composition of this Bromo-Iodide of Silver, so
called, is uncertain, and has not been proved to bear any
analogy to that of the mixed salt obtained by decomposing
a solution of Iodide and Bromide of Potassium with
Nitrate of Silver. Observe also that the Bromo-Iodide of
Silver is more sensitive than the simple Iodide <i>only token
the vapour of Mercury is employed as a developer</i>. M.
Claudet proves that if the image be formed by the direct
action of light alone (see <a href="#Page_174">page 174</a>), the usual condition is
reversed, and that the use of Bromine under such circumstances
retards the effect.</p>

<p><i>The Development and Properties of the Image.</i>&mdash;The latent
image of the Daguerreotype is developed in a manner
different from that of the humid processes generally,&mdash;viz.
by the action of Mercurial vapour. Mercury, or Quicksilver,
is a metallic fluid which boils at 662° Fahrenheit.
We are not however to suppose that the iodized plate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
subjected to the vapour of Mercury at a temperature at
all approaching to 662°. The cup containing the Quicksilver
is previously heated by means of a spirit-lamp to about
140°, a temperature easily borne by the hand, in most
cases, without inconvenience. The amount of Mercurial
vapour evolved at 140° is very small, but it is sufficient for
the purpose, and after continuing the action for a short
time the image is perfectly developed.</p>

<p>There are few questions which have given rise to greater
discussion amongst chemists than the nature of the Daguerreotype
image. Unfortunately, the quantity of material
to be operated on is so small, that it becomes almost
impossible to ascertain its composition by direct analysis.
Some suppose it to consist of Mercury alone. Others have
thought that the Mercury is in combination with metallic
Silver. The presence of the former metal is certain, since
M. Claudet shows that, by the application of a strong heat,
it can actually be volatilized from the image in sufficient
quantity to develope a second impression immediately superimposed.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that an image more or less resembling
that developed by Mercury can be obtained by
<i>the prolonged action</i> of light alone upon the iodized plate.
The substance so formed is a white powder, insoluble in
solution of Hyposulphite of Soda; amorphous to the eye,
but presenting the appearance of minute reflecting crystals
when highly magnified. Its composition is uncertain.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes the production of the Daguerreotype
image by light alone is useless, on account of the
length of time required to effect it. This was alluded to
in the third Chapter, where it was shown that in the case
of the Bromo-Iodide of Silver an intensity of light 3000
times greater is required, if the use of the Mercurial vapour
be omitted.</p>

<p><i>M. Ed. Becquerel's discovery of the continuing action of
rays of yellow light.</i>&mdash;Pure homogeneous yellow light has
no action upon the Daguerreotype plate; but if the iodized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
surface be first exposed to white light for a sufficient time
to impress a latent image, and then <i>afterwards</i> to the yellow
light, the action already commenced is <i>continued</i>, and
even to the extent of forming the peculiar white deposit,
insoluble in Hyposulphite of Soda, already alluded to.</p>

<p>Yellow light may therefore in this sense be spoken of as
a <i>developing</i> agent, since it produces the same effect as
the Mercurial vapour in bringing out to view the latent
image.</p>

<p>A singular anomaly however requires notice, viz. that if
the plate be prepared with the mixed vapours of Bromine
and Iodine, in place of Iodine alone, then the yellow light
cannot be made to develope the image. In fact, the same
coloured ray which continues the action of white light
upon a surface of <i>Iodide</i> of Silver, actually <i>destroys</i> it, and
restores the particles to their original condition, with a
surface of <i>Bromo</i>-Iodide of Silver.</p>

<p>These facts, although not of great practical importance,
are interesting in illustration of the delicate and complex
nature of the chemical changes produced by light.</p>

<p><i>The Strengthening of the Daguerreotype Image by means
of Hyposulphite of Gold.</i>&mdash;The use of the Hyposulphite
of Gold to whiten the Daguerreotype image, and render
it more lasting and indestructible, was introduced by M.
Fizeau, subsequent to the original discovery of the process.</p>

<p>After removal of the unaltered Iodide of Silver by
means of Hyposulphite of Soda, the plate is placed upon
a levelling stand and covered with a solution of Hyposulphite
of Gold, containing about one part of the salt dissolved
in 500 parts of water. The flame of a spirit-lamp
is then applied until the liquid begins to boil. Shortly a
change is seen to take place in the appearance of the
image; it becomes whiter than before, and acquires great
force. This fact seems to prove conclusively that metallic
Mercury enters into its composition, since a surface of
Silver&mdash;such, for instance, as that of the Collodion image&mdash;is
<i>darkened</i> by Hyposulphite of Gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The difference in the action of the gilding solution upon
the image and the pure Silver surrounding it illustrates
the same fact. This Silver, which appears of a dark colour,
and forms the shadows of the image, is rendered still
darker; a very delicate crust of metallic Gold <i>gradually</i>
forming upon it, whereas with the image the whitening
effect is immediate and striking.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Theory of the Talbotype and Albumen Processes.</i></p>

<p><i>The Talbotype or Calotype.</i>&mdash;This process, as practiced
by many at the present time, is almost identical with that
originally described by Mr. Fox Talbot. The object is to
obtain an even and finely divided layer of Iodide of Silver
upon the surface of a sheet of paper; the particles of the
Iodide being left in contact with an excess of Nitrate of
Silver, and usually with a small proportion of Gallic Acid,
to heighten, still further, the sensibility to light.</p>

<p>The English papers sized with Gelatine are commonly
used for the Calotype process; they retain the film more perfectly
at the surface, and the Gelatine in all probability
assists in forming the image. With a foreign starch-paper,
unless it be re-sized with some organic substance, the solutions
sink in too deeply, and the picture is wanting in
clearness and definition.</p>

<p>There are two modes of iodizing and sensitizing the
sheets: first, by floating alternately upon Iodide of Potassium
and Nitrate of Silver, in the same manner as in the
preparation of papers for Positive Printing; and second,
by what is termed "the single wash," which is thought by
many to give superior results as regards sensitiveness and
intensity of image. To iodize by this mode, the yellow
Iodide of Silver, prepared by mixing solutions of Iodide
of Potassium and Nitrate of Silver, is dissolved in a strong
solution of Iodide of Potassium; the sheets are floated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
an instant upon this liquid and dried; they are then removed
to a dish of water, by the action of which the
Iodide of Silver is precipitated upon the surface of the
paper in a finely divided state.</p>

<p>The properties of a solution of Iodide of Silver in Iodide
of Potassium, or of the double Iodide of Potassium and
Silver, are described at <a href="#Page_43">page 43</a>, a reference to which will
show that the double salt is decomposed by a large quantity
of water, with precipitation of the Iodide of Silver, this
substance being insoluble in a dilute solution of Iodide of
Potassium, although soluble in a strong solution.</p>

<p>Paper coated with Iodide of Silver by this mode, after
proper washing in water to remove soluble salts (which if
allowed to remain would attract damp), will keep good for
a long time. The layer of Iodide appears of a pale primrose
colour, and is perfectly insensitive to light. Even exposure
to the sun's rays produces no change, thus indicating
that an excess of Nitrate of Silver is essential to the
visible darkening of Iodide of Silver by light. The paper
is also insensitive to the reception of an invisible image,
differing in this respect from the washed Collodion plate,
which receives an impression in the Camera, although apparently
freed from Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p>To render Calotype paper sensitive to light, it is brushed
with a solution of Nitrate of Silver containing both Acetic
and Gallic Acids, termed "Aceto-Nitrate" and "Gallo-Nitrate"
solution. The Gallic Acid lessens the keeping
qualities of the paper, but increases the sensitiveness.
The Acetic Acid prevents the paper from blackening all
over during the development, and preserves the clearness
of the white parts; its employment is indispensable.</p>

<p>The paper is commonly excited upon the morning of the
day upon which it is intended to be used; and the longer
it is kept, the less active and certain it becomes. An exposure
of five to eight minutes in the Camera is the average
time with an ordinary view lens.</p>

<p>The picture is developed with a saturated solution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Gallic Acid, to which a portion of Aceto-Nitrate of Silver
is added to heighten the intensity. Both Sulphate of Iron,
and Pyrogallic Acid have also been used, but they are unnecessarily
strong, the invisible image being more easily developed
upon paper than upon Collodion (see <a href="#Page_143">page 143</a>).</p>

<p>After fixing the Negative by removing the unaltered
Iodide of Silver with Hyposulphite of Soda, it is well
washed and dried. White wax is then melted in with a
hot iron, so as to render the paper transparent, and to
facilitate the after-process of printing.</p>

<p>The Calotype cannot be compared with the Collodion
process for sensitiveness and delicacy of detail, but it possesses
advantages for tourists and those who do not wish
to be encumbered with large glass plates. The principal
difficulty appears to be in obtaining a uniformly good
paper, many samples giving a speckled appearance in the
black parts of the Negative.</p>

<p><i>The Waxed Paper process of Le Grey.</i>&mdash;This is a useful
modification of the Talbotype introduced by M. Le Grey.
The paper is waxed before iodizing, by which, without involving
any additional operation, a very fine surface layer
of Iodide of Silver can be obtained. The Waxed Paper
Process is well adapted for tourists, from its extreme simplicity
and the length of time which the film may be kept
in a sensitive condition.</p>

<p>Both English and foreign papers are employed: but the
former take the wax with difficulty. Mr. Crookes, who
has devoted his attention to this process, gives clear directions
for waxing paper; it is essential that pure white wax
should be obtained direct from the bleachers, since the
flat cakes sold in the shops are commonly adulterated.
The <i>temperature</i> must also be carefully kept below that
point at which decomposition of the wax takes place; the
use of too hot an iron being a common source of failure
(see 'Photographic Journal,' vol. ii. p. 231).</p>

<p>The sheets of paper, having been properly waxed, are
soaked for <i>two hours</i> in a solution containing Iodide and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Bromide of Potassium, with, enough free Iodine to tinge
the liquid of a port-wine colour. The greasy nature of
wax impedes the entry of liquids, and hence a long immersion
is required. The iodizing formulæ of the French
Photographers have been encumbered by the addition of
a variety of substances which appear to introduce complications
without giving proportional advantage, and Mr.
Townshend has done the art a service by proving that the
Iodide and Bromide of Potassium, with free Iodine, are
sufficient. This latter ingredient was first used by Mr.
Crookes; it seems to add to the clearness and sharpness
of the Negatives; and as the papers are <i>coloured</i> by the
Iodine, air-bubbles cannot escape detection. The process
of exciting with Nitrate of Silver is also rendered more
certain by the employment of free Iodine, the action of the
Bath being continued until the purple colour gives place
to the characteristic yellow tint of the Iodide of Silver.</p>

<p>Waxed Paper is rendered sensitive by immersion in a
Bath of Nitrate of Silver containing Acetic Acid; the quantity
of which latter ingredient should be increased when
the papers are to be long kept. As the excess of Nitrate
is subsequently removed, the solution may be used weaker
than in the Calotype or Collodion process.</p>

<p>After exciting, the papers are washed with water to reduce
the amount of free Nitrate of Silver to a minimum.
This lessens the sensitiveness, but greatly increases the
keeping qualities, and the paper will often remain good for
ten days or longer.</p>

<p>It is a very important point, in operating with Waxed
Paper, to keep the developing dishes clean. The development
is conducted by immersion in a Bath of Gallic Acid
containing Acetic Acid and Nitrate of Silver; and being
retarded by the superficial coating of wax, there is always
a tendency to an irregular reduction of Silver upon
the white portions of the Negative. When the developer
becomes brown and discoloured, this is almost sure to
happen; and it is well known to chemists that the length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of time during which Gallic Acid and Nitrate of Silver may
remain mixed without decomposing, is much lessened by
using vessels which are dirty from having been before employed
for a similar purpose. The black deposit of Silver
exercises a <i>catalytic</i> (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#962;, decomposition by contact)
action upon the freshly-mixed portion, and hastens its discoloration.</p>

<p>The Waxed Paper process is exceedingly simple and inexpensive,&mdash;very
suitable for tourists, as requiring but little
experience, and a minimum of apparatus. It is however
slow and tedious in all its stages, the sensitive papers frequently
taking an exposure of twenty minutes in the Camera,
and the development extending over an hour or an hour
and a half. Several Negatives however may be developed
at the same time; and as the removal of the free Nitrate of
Silver gives the process a great advantage during hot weather,
it will in all probability continue to be extensively
followed. The prints which have been sent to the Exhibition
of the Photographic Society, show that waxed paper
in the hands of a skilful operator may be made to delineate
architectural subjects with great fidelity, and also to give
the details of foliage and landscape Photography with distinctness.</p>

<p><i>The Albumen process upon Glass.</i>&mdash;The process with
Albumen originated in a desire to obtain a more even surface
layer of Iodide of Silver than the coarse structure
of the tissue of paper will allow. It is conducted with
simple Albumen, or "white of eggs," diluted with a convenient
quantity of water. In this glutinous liquid Iodide
of Potassium is dissolved; and the solution, having been
thoroughly shaken, is set aside, the upper portion being
drawn off for use, in the same manner as in the preparation
of Albuminized paper for printing.</p>

<p>The glasses are coated with the Iodized Albumen, and
are then placed horizontally in a box to dry. This part of
the process is considered the most troublesome, the moist
Albumen easily attracting particles of dust, and being apt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to blister and separate from the glass. If an even layer
of the dried and Iodized material can be obtained, the
chief difficulty of the process has been overcome.</p>

<p>The plates are rendered sensitive by immersion in a
Bath of Nitrate of Silver with Acetic Acid added, and
are then washed in water and dried. They may be kept
for a long time in an excited state.</p>

<p>The exposure in the Camera must be unusually long;
the free Nitrate of Silver having been removed by washing,
and the Albumen exercising a direct retarding influence
upon the sensitiveness of Iodide of Silver.</p>

<p>The development is conducted in the ordinary way by a
mixture of Gallic Acid and Nitrate of Silver, with Acetic
Acid added to preserve the clearness of the lights. It
usually requires one hour or more, but may be accelerated
by the gentle application of heat.</p>

<p>Albumen pictures are remarkable for elaborate distinctness
in the shadows and minor details, and are admirably
adapted for viewing in the Stereoscope; but they
do not often possess the peculiar and characteristic <i>softness</i>
of the Photograph upon Collodion. The process is well
adapted for hot climates, being very little prone to the
cloudiness and irregular reduction of Silver which are
often complained of with moist Collodion under such circumstances.</p>

<p><i>M. Taupenot's Collodio-Albumen process.</i>&mdash;This is a recent
discovery which seems to involve a new principle in
the Art, and gives promise of great utility.</p>

<p>One of the greatest objections to the Albumen process
has been its want of sensitiveness; but M. Taupenot found
that this was obviated to a great extent by pouring the Albumen
upon a plate <i>previously coated with Iodide of Silver</i>.
In this way two layers of that sensitive salt are formed,
and the sensibility of the surface layer, which alone receives
the image, is promoted by its resting upon a substratum
of Iodide rather than upon the inert surface of
the glass. In this view, if the theory be correct, the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
particle of Iodide of Silver promotes the molecular disturbance
of the upper, itself remaining unchanged.</p>

<p>Other experimenters, pursuing the subject further, have
asserted that a successful result may be obtained by coating
the plate with plain Collodion and subsequently with
Iodized Albumen. If this observation should prove correct,
the process will be simplified and its utility increased.</p>

<p>In the sixth Chapter of Part II. the practical details of
the Collodio-Albumen process will be described.</p>

<p class="caption4nb">THE SOLUBLE PAPER.</p>

<p>Pyroxyline may be prepared either from cotton wool or

better adapted for use with the Sulphuric Acid and Nitre,

about five shillings the quire. Each half-sheet has the water-mark "J. H.

<p>Preparation of a Nitro-Sulphuric Acid of the proper
strength.&mdash;There are two modes of preparing the Nitro-Sulphuric
Acid: first, by mixing the acids; second, by
the Oil of Vitriol and Nitre Process. The former is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
best in cases where large quantities of the material are
operated on, but the amateur is recommended to begin by
trying the Nitre Process (<a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>) as the most simple.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">PREPARATION OF NITRO-SULPHURIC ACID BY THE MIXED
ACIDS.</p>

<p>The operator may proceed in either of two ways; first,
by taking the strength of each sample of acid, and mixing
according to fixed rule; second, by a more ready plan,
which may be used when the exact strength of the acids
is not known. Each of these will be described in succession.</p>

<p>a. <i>Directions for mixing according to fixed rule.</i>&mdash;This
process is given from Mr. Hadow's original paper in the
'Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society.' It is certain
in its results if the strength of both acids be accurately
determined.</p>

<p>A very perfect process for taking the strength of Nitric
Acid is by means of powdered Marble or Carbonate of
Lime, as described in various works on practical Chemistry.
Sulphuric Acid may be estimated by precipitating with
Nitrate of Baryta, and weighing the insoluble Sulphate
with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>The specific gravity is not a criterion of strength to be
perfectly relied on, but if it be adopted as a test, the following
points must be attended to.</p>

<p>1st. That the temperature of the acid be at or near 60°
Fahrenheit; the density of Sulphuric Acid especially is,
from its small specific heat, greatly influenced a change
of temperature.</p>

<p>2nd. The sample of Nitric Acid must be free from Peroxide
of Nitrogen, or only slightly coloured by it. This
substance, when present, increases the specific gravity of
the acid without adding to its available properties. A
yellow sample of Nitric Acid will therefore be somewhat
weaker than is indicated by the specific gravity.</p>

<p>3rd. The Oil of Vitriol should yield no solid residue on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
evaporation. Sulphate of Lead and Bisulphate of Potash
are often found in the commercial acid, and add much to
its density. Oil of Vitriol containing Sulphate of Lead
becomes milky on dilution.</p>

<p>The formula for a definite Nitro-Sulphuric Acid, of the
proper strength for making the soluble Pyroxyline, may be
stated thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>A preliminary experiment with a small tuft of Cotton
Wool (cotton shows it better than paper) will then indicate
the actual strength of the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid. Stir the
tuft in the mixture for five minutes. Remove with a glass
rod, and wash with water for a short time, until no acid
taste can be perceived. If the Wool becomes <i>matted</i>, and
gelatinizes slightly on its first immersion in the acid, or if,
in the subsequent washing, the fibres appear to adhere and
to be disintegrated by the action of the water, <i>the Nitro-Sulphuric
Acid is too weak</i>. In that case add to the acid
mixture.</p>

<p class="tdc">
Oil of Vitriol, 3 drachms.<br />
</p>

<p>If the cotton was actually <i>dissolved</i> in the first trial, an
addition of half of a fluid ounce of Oil of Vitriol may be
required.</p>

<p>Supposing the cotton not to be gelatinized and to wash
well, then wring it out very dry, pull out the fibres, and
treat it in a test-tube with rectified Ether,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to which a few
drops of Alcohol have been added. If it be <i>insoluble</i>, dry
it by a gentle heat and apply a flame: a brisk explosion
indicates that the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid employed is <i>too
strong</i>. In that case, add to the twenty drachms of mixed
acids, one drachm of water, and test again, repeating the
process until a soluble product is obtained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Observe that the Ether be pure; if it contains too much water and

the Cotton mat together very slightly or not at all on immersion,
and the washing proceeds tolerably well; the compound
formed is scarcely explosive, and dissolves imperfectly
in Ether, leaving little nodules or hard lumps. The
ethereal solution yields, on evaporation, a film which is
opaque instead of transparent. In this case (presuming
the Ether to be good) the acid mixture is slightly too weak,
or the temperature is too low, being probably about 90°,
instead of 130° to 140° (?).</p>

<p>When the acid mixture has been brought to the proper
strength by a few preliminary trials, proceed according to
the directions given at the next page.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">PREPARATION OF NITRO-SULPHURIC ACID BY OIL OF
VITRIOL AND NITRE.</p>

<p>This process is recommended, in preference to the other,
to the amateur who is unable to obtain Nitric Acid of convenient
strength. The common Oil of Vitriol sold in the
shops is often very good for Photographic purposes; but
it is best, if possible, to take the specific gravity, when any
doubt exists of its genuineness. At a temperature of 58°
to 60°, specific gravity 1·833 is the usual strength, and if it
falls below this, it should be rejected. (See Part III. for
'Impurities of Commercial Sulphuric Acid.')</p>

<p>The Nitre must be the purest sample which can be obtained.
Commercial Nitre often contains a large quantity
of <i>Chloride of Potassium</i>, detected on dissolving the Nitre
in distilled water, and adding a drop or two of solution of
Nitrate of Silver. If a milkiness and subsequent curdy
deposit is formed. Chlorides are present. These Chlorides
are injurious; after the Oil of Vitriol is added, they destroy
a portion of Nitric Acid by converting it into brown
fumes of Peroxide of Nitrogen, and so alter the strength
of the solution.</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of Potash is an anhydrous salt</i>,&mdash;it contains
simply Nitric Acid and Potash, without any water of crystallization;
still, in many cases, a little water is retained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
mechanically between the interstices of the crystals, and
therefore it is better to dry it before use. This may be
done by laying it in a state of fine powder upon blotting-paper,
close to a fire, or upon a heated metallic plate.</p>

<p>The sample must also be reduced to a fine powder before
adding the Oil of Vitriol; otherwise portions of the salt
escape decomposition.</p>

<p>These preliminaries having been properly observed,
weigh out</p>

<p class="tdc">
Pure Nitre, powdered and dried, 600 grains.<br />
</p>

<p>This quantity is equivalent to 1&frac14; ounce Troy or Apothecaries'
weight;&mdash;and to 1&frac14; ounce Avoirdupois weight <i>plus</i>
54 grains. Place this in a teacup or any other convenient
vessel, and pour upon it.</p>

<p>Stir well with a glass rod for two or three minutes, until
all effervescence has ceased, and an even, pasty mixture,
free from lumps, is obtained.</p>

<p>During the whole process, abundance of dense fumes
of Nitric Acid will be given off, which must be allowed to
escape up the flue or into the open air.</p>

<p><i>A modification of the formula.</i>&mdash;The above formula will
invariably succeed with a good sample of acid and pure
Nitre. When tried however with Oil of Vitriol rather
weaker than ordinary, and <i>commercial</i> Nitre, it may fail,
the cotton being gelatinized and dissolved. When such is
the case, the addition of water must be omitted or the
quantity reduced from one drachm and a half to half a
drachm.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR IMMERSING, WASHING, AND
DRYING THE PYROXYLINE.</p>

<p>The mixture of Sulphuric Acid and Nitre requires to be
used immediately after its preparation, as it solidifies into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
a stiff mass on cooling; but the mixed acids may be kept
for any length of time in a stoppered bottle.</p>

<p>When Cotton is used, the fibres should be well pulled
out, and small tufts added one by one to the acid mixture,
stirring with a glass rod in order to keep up a constant
change of particles. The Paper is cut into squares or
strips, which are introduced singly.</p>

<p>In either case the quantity must not be too great, or
some portions will be imperfectly acted upon; about 20
grains to each fluid ounce of the mixture will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The <i>time of immersion required</i> varies from ten minutes
with Cotton, to twenty minutes or even half an hour with
the Paper. When an unusually large proportion of Sulphuric
Acid is used, as in the case of a weak sample of
Nitric Acid, the Cotton should be removed at the expiration
of six or seven minutes, as there is a tendency to partial
solution of the Pyroxyline in the acid mixture under
those circumstances.</p>

<p>It is an advantage in some cases to prepare the material
at a high temperature, but unless the proportions of the
Acids are strictly according to Mr. Hadow's formula, solution
of the Cotton may take place if the thermometer indicates
more than 140°.</p>

<p>After the action is complete, the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid is
left weaker than before, from addition of various atoms
of water necessarily formed during the change. Hence, if
the same portion be used more than once, an addition of
Sulphuric Acid will be required.</p>

<p><i>Directions for Washing.</i>&mdash;In removing the Pyroxyline
from the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid, press out as much of the
liquid as possible, and wash it rapidly in a large quantity
of cold water, using a glass rod to preserve the fingers
from injury. If it were simply thrown into a small quantity
of water and allowed to remain, the rise in temperature
and weakening of the acid mixture might do mischief.</p>

<p>The washing should be continued for at least a quarter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of an hour, or longer in the case of Paper, as it is essential
to get rid of every trace of acid. When the Nitre plan
has been adopted, a portion of the <i>Bisulphate of Potash</i>
formed adheres to the fibres, and if not carefully washed
out, an opalescent appearance is seen in the Collodion, resulting
from the insolubility of this salt in the ethereal
mixture.</p>

<p>If no acid taste can be perceived, and a piece of blue
litmus-paper remains in contact with the fibres for five
minutes without changing in colour, the product is thoroughly
washed. It is however a safe plan to place the
Pyroxyline in running water and allow it to remain for several
hours.</p>

<p>Lastly, wring it out in a cloth, pull out the fibres, and
dry slowly, by a moderate heat. After drying, it may be
kept for any length of time in a stoppered bottle.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">RECAPITULATION OF THE GENERAL CHARACTERS OF PYROXYLINE
PREPARED IN NITRO-SULPHURIC ACID OF
VARIOUS DEGREES OF CONCENTRATION.</p>

<p><i>The acid mixture too strong.</i>&mdash;The appearance of the
cotton is not much altered on its first immersion in the
mixture. It washes well, without any disintegration. On
drying, it is found to be strong in texture, and produces
a peculiar crackling sensation between the fingers, like
starch. It explodes on the application of flame, without
leaving any ash. It is insoluble in the mixture of Ether
and Alcohol, but dissolves if treated with Acetic Ether.</p>

<p><i>The acid mixture of the proper strength.</i>&mdash;No agglutination
of the fibres of the cotton on immersion, and the
product washes well; soluble in the ethereal mixture, and
yields a <i>transparent</i> film on evaporation.</p>

<p><i>The acid mixture too weak.</i>&mdash;The fibres of the cotton
agglutinate, and the Pyroxyline is washed with difficulty.
On drying, the texture is found to be short and rotten. It
does not explode on being heated, but either burns quietly
with a flame, leaving behind a black ash&mdash;in which case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it consists simply of unaltered cotton,&mdash;or is only slightly
combustible, and not explosive. It dissolves more or less
perfectly in glacial Acetic Acid. When treated with the
ethereal mixture, it is acted on <i>partially</i>, leaving behind
lumps of unchanged cotton; the solution does not form an
even transparent layer on evaporation, but becomes opaque
and cloudy as it dries. This opacity however may be seen
to a small extent with any sample of Pyroxyline, if the solvents
contain too much water.</p>

<p>In using Swedish Paper in place of Cotton, the Pyroxyline
formed in too weak a Nitro-Sulphuric Acid is usually
insoluble in Ether and Alcohol, and burns slowly like unchanged
paper.</p>

<p>By studying these characters, and at the same time
bearing in mind that <i>a drachm and a half of water</i> in the
quantities of acid given in the formula (<a href="#Page_188">p. 188</a>) will suffice
to cause the difference, the operator will overcome all difficulties.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">PURIFICATION OF THE SOLVENTS REQUIRED FOR
COLLODION.</p>

<p>The purity of the Ether employed is a matter of as much
importance in the manufacture of a good Collodion as that
of any other ingredient; this point must be attended to in
order to secure a good result.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of Ether sold by manufacturing
chemists; first, ordinary rectified Sulphuric Ether, containing
a certain percentage of Alcohol and of water; specific
gravity about ·750. Second, the washed Ether, which
is the same agitated with an equal bulk of water, to remove
the Alcohol: by this proceeding the specific gravity of the
fluid is reduced considerably. Third, Ether both washed
and re-rectified from a caustic alkali, so as to contain neither
Alcohol nor water; in this case the specific gravity
should not be higher than ·720. Fourth, "Methylated"
Ether, manufactured at a lower price than the others.</p>

<p>Rectified Ether of 750° is not to be depended on, inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
as the specific gravity is often made up by adding
water instead of alcohol. Methylated Ether should be
used only when economy is an object, as it is prone to
acidity and less certain in its properties.</p>

<p>Some of the qualities which render Ether unfit for Photographic
purposes, are as follows:&mdash;a peculiar and disagreeable
smell, either of some essential oil, or of Acetic
Ether; an acid reaction to test-paper; a property of
turning alcoholic solution of Iodide of Potassium brown
with unusual rapidity; an alkaline reaction to test-paper;
a high specific gravity, from superabundance of Alcohol
and water.</p>

<p>The Ether which has been both washed and redistilled
is always the most uniform in composition, and especially
so if the second distillation be conducted from Quicklime,
Carbonate of Potash, or Caustic Potash. These Alkaline
substances retain the impurities, which are often of an acid
nature, and leave the Ether in a fit state for use.</p>

<p>The redistillation of Ether is a simple process: in dealing
with this fluid however the greatest caution must be
exercised, on account of its inflammable nature. Even in
pouring Ether from one bottle into another, if a light of
any kind be near, the vapour is apt to take fire; and severe
injuries have been occasioned from this cause.</p>

<p><i>Purification of Ether by redistillation from a caustic
or carbonated alkali.</i>&mdash;Take ordinary rectified Sulphuric
Ether, and agitate it with an equal bulk of water to wash
out the Alcohol; stand for a few minutes until the contents
of the bottle separate into two distinct strata, the lower of
which&mdash;<i>id est</i>, the watery stratum&mdash;is to be drawn off and
rejected. Then introduce Caustic Potash, finely powdered,
in the proportion of about one ounce to a pint of the
washed Ether; shake the bottle again many times, in
order that the water&mdash;a small portion of which is still present
in solution in the Ether&mdash;may be thoroughly absorbed.
Afterwards set aside for twenty-four hours (not longer, or
the Potash may begin to decompose the Ether), when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
will probably be observed that the liquid has become yellow,
and that a flocculent deposit has formed in small quantity.
Transfer to a retort of moderate capacity, supported
in a saucepan of warm water, and properly connected with
a condenser. On applying a gentle heat, the Ether distils
over quietly, and condenses with very little loss; care must
be taken that none of the alkaline liquid contained in the
body of the retort finds its way, by projection or otherwise,
into the neck, so as to run down and contaminate the
distilled fluid.</p>

<p>A more economical plan of purifying Ether is, without
previous washing with water, to agitate with Carbonate of
Potash or with Quicklime, and redistil at a moderate temperature.</p>

<p>In order to preserve Ether from decomposition, it must
be kept in stoppered bottles, nearly full, and in a dark
place. The stoppers should be tied over with bladder and
luted, or a considerable amount of evaporation will take
place, unless the neck of the bottle has been ground with
unusual care. After the lapse of some months, probably a
certain amount of decomposition, evidenced by the liberation
of Iodine on adding Iodide of Potassium, will be found
to have taken place. This however is small in amount,
and not of a character to injure the fluid.</p>

<p>Rectification of Spirits of Wine from Carbonate of
Potash.&mdash;The object of this operation is to remove a
portion of water from the spirit, and so to increase its
strength. Alcohol thus purified may be added to Collodion
almost to any extent, without producing glutinosity
and rottenness of film.</p>

<p>The salt termed Carbonate of Potash is a deliquescent
salt,&mdash;that is, it has a great attraction for water; consequently
when Spirits of Wine are agitated with Carbonate
of Potash, a portion of water is removed, the salt
dissolving in it and forming a dense liquid, which refuses
to mix with the Alcohol, and sinks to the bottom. At the
expiration of two or three days, if the bottle has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
shaken frequently, the action is complete, and the lower
stratum of fluid may be drawn off and rejected. <i>Pure</i>
Carbonate of Potash is an expensive salt, and a commoner
variety may be taken. It should be well dried on a heated
metal plate, and powdered, before use.</p>

<p>The quantity may be about two ounces to a pint of
spirit; or more, if an unusually concentrated Alcohol is
required.</p>

<p>After the distillation is complete, a fluid is obtained containing
about 90 per cent, of absolute Alcohol, the remaining
10 per cent, being water. The specific gravity at 60°
Fahrenheit should be from ·815 to ·825; commercial Spirit
of Wine being ·836 to ·840.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">PREPARATION OF THE IODIZING COMPOUNDS IN A STATE OF PURITY.</p>

<p>These are the Iodides of Potassium, Ammonium, and
Cadmium. The properties of each are more fully described
in Part III.</p>

<p>a. <i>The Iodide of Potassium.</i>&mdash;Iodide of Potassium, as
sold in the shops, is often contaminated with various impurities.
The first and most remarkable is <i>Carbonate of
Potash</i>. When a sample of Iodide of Potassium contains
much Carbonate of Potash, it forms small and imperfect
crystals, which are strongly alkaline to test-paper, and become
moist on exposure to the air, from the deliquescent
nature of the Alkaline Carbonate. <i>Sulphate of Potash</i> is
also a common impurity; it may be detected by Chloride
of Barium.</p>

<p>A third impurity of Iodide of Potassium is <i>Chloride</i> of
Potassium; it is detected as follows:&mdash;Precipitate the salt
by an equal weight of Nitrate of Silver, and treat the yellow
mass with solution of Ammonia; if any Chloride of
Silver is present, it dissolves in the Ammonia, and, after
filtration, is precipitated in white curds by the addition
of an excess of pure Nitric Acid. If the Nitric Acid employed
is not pure, but contains traces of free Chlorine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the Iodide of Silver must be well washed with distilled
water before treating it with Ammonia, or the excess of
free Nitrate of Silver dissolving in the Ammonia would,
on neutralizing, produce Chloride of Silver, and so cause
an error.</p>

<p><i>Iodate of Potash</i> is a fourth impurity often found in
Iodide of Potassium: to detect it, add a drop of dilute Sulphuric
Acid, or a crystal of Citric Acid, to the solution of
the Iodide; when, if much Iodate be present, the liquid
will become yellow from liberation of free Iodine. The rationale
of this reaction is as follows:&mdash;The Sulphuric Acid
unites with the base of the salt, and liberates Hydriodic
Acid (HI), <i>a colourless compound;</i> but if Iodic Acid (IO<sub>5</sub>)
be also present, it decomposes the Hydriodic Acid first
formed, oxidizing the Hydrogen into Water (HO), and setting
free the Iodine. The immediate production of a yellow
colour on adding a weak acid to aqueous solution of Iodide
of Potassium, is therefore a proof of the presence of an
Iodate. As Iodate of Potash renders Collodion insensitive,
this point should be attended to.</p>

<p>Iodide of Potassium may be rendered very pure by
recrystallizing from Spirit, or by dissolving in strong
Alcohol of sp. gr. ·823, in which Sulphate, Carbonate, and
Iodate of Potash are insoluble. The proportion of Iodide
of Potassium contained in saturated Alcoholic solutions
varies with the strength of the spirit (<i>vide</i> Part III.,
article Iodide of Potassium).</p>

<p>Solution of Chloride of Barium is commonly used to
detect impurities in Iodide of Potassium; it forms a white
precipitate if Carbonate, Iodate, or Sulphate be present.
In the two former cases the precipitate dissolves on the
addition of pure dilute Nitric Acid, but in the latter it is
insoluble. The commercial Iodide however is rarely so
pure as to remain quite clear on the addition of Chloride
of Barium.</p>

<p>b. <i>The Iodide of Ammonium.</i>&mdash;This salt may be prepared
by adding Carbonate of Ammonia to Iodide of Iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
but more easily by the following process:&mdash;A strong solution
of Hydrosulphate of Ammonia is first made, by passing
Sulphuretted Hydrogen gas into Liquor Ammoniæ.
To this liquid, Iodine is added until the whole of the
Sulphuret of Ammonium has been converted into Iodide.
When this point is reached, the solution at once colours
brown from solution of free Iodine. On the first addition
of the Iodine, an escape of Sulphuretted Hydrogen gas
and a dense deposit of Sulphur take place. After the decomposition
of the Hydrosulphate of Ammonia is complete,
a portion of Hydriodic Acid&mdash;formed by the mutual
reaction of Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Iodine&mdash;attacks
any Carbonate of Ammonia which may be present, and
causes an effervescence. The effervescence being over,
the liquid is still acid to test-paper, from excess of Hydriodic
Acid; it is to be cautiously neutralized with Ammonia,
and evaporated by the heat of a water-bath to the
crystallizing point.</p>

<p>The crystals should be thoroughly dried over a dish of
Sulphuric Acid, and then sealed in tubes; by this means
it will be preserved colourless.</p>

<p>Iodide of Ammonium is very soluble in Alcohol, but it
is not advisable to keep it in solution, from the rapidity
with which it decomposes and becomes brown.</p>

<p>The most common impurity of commercial Iodide of
Ammonium is Sulphate of Ammonia; it is detected by its
sparing solubility in Alcohol. Carbonate of Ammonia is
also frequently present to a large extent, in which case an
alkaline Collodion and eventually an alkaline Nitrate Bath
will be produced.</p>

<p>e. <i>Iodide of Cadmium.</i>&mdash;This salt is formed by heating
filings of metallic Cadmium with Iodine, or by mixing the
two together with addition of water.</p>

<p>Iodide of Cadmium is very soluble both in Alcohol and
Water; the solution yielding on evaporation large six-sided
tables of a pearly lustre, which are permanent in the
air. The commercial Iodide is sometimes contaminated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
with Iodide of Zinc; the crystals being imperfectly formed
and slowly liberating Iodine when dissolved in Ether and
Alcohol. Pure Iodide of Cadmium remains nearly or quite
colourless in Collodion, if the fluid be kept in a cool and
dark place.</p>

<p>Of the two formulæ above given, the first is considered
the best, but the second may be substituted for it when
highly rectified spirits cannot be obtained. Iodide of Ammonium
chemically pure is perhaps superior to any other
Iodide for preparing a portrait Collodion, but Iodide of
Cadmium, with addition of free Iodine, possesses better
keeping properties, and gives very good results. A mixture
of the two Iodides may also be used advantageously,
or Iodide of <i>Potassium</i> may be combined with Iodide of
Cadmium: this preparation has been much recommended,
but the Collodion will be liable to produce a spotted film
unless the salts are quite pure.</p>

<p>The exact quantity of Pyroxyline will vary with the
temperature at which the preparation was made. The
Collodion should flow smoothly on the glass and remain
free from crapy lines on setting. When Iodide of Cadmium
is used, the tendency to glutinosity will be a little
greater than usual, which must be obviated by the directions
given at <a href="#Page_83">page 83</a>.</p>

<p>The film, after dipping in the Bath, should appear opalescent
and not too yellow and creamy. Pale-blue films yield
very good Positives, but with more liability to failure than
thicker films (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>If the Positives are not perfectly clear and transparent
in the shadows, dissolve 5 grains of Iodine in an ounce of
Spirits of Wine (not methylated), and add a few drops until
the Collodion assumes a golden-yellow colour.</p>

<p>In hot weather advantage will be gained by somewhat
increasing the quantity of Alcohol in Collodion; the evaporation
of the solvents being retarded, and the film rendered
less liable to become dry before development. <i>Anhydrous</i>
Alcohol of Sp. Gr. ·796, may be mixed with pure
Ether of ·715, even to the extent of equal parts; but this
is the extreme limit, and with the strongest spirit ordinarily
obtainable, the Collodion will often become somewhat
glutinous if the proportions (by measure) of 5 parts
of Ether to 3 of Alcohol be exceeded.</p>

<p>Collodion prepared by Formula No. 1, and iodized with
Iodide of Cadmium, may be kept for weeks or months
without much loss of sensitiveness; but when Alkaline
Iodides are employed as in the second Formula, Iodine is
liberated, and the fluid becomes at last brown and insensitive.</p>

<p>Nitrate of Silver which has been melted, in order to
expel Oxides of Nitrogen, is always the most certain in
its action: but the heat must not be raised too high or the
salt will be contaminated with <i>Nitrite</i> of Silver.</p>

<p>In the Vocabulary (see Part III.) directions are given
for the preparation and purification of Nitrate of Silver;
also for the testing of distilled water, and the best substitutes
when it cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>The Bath must be saturated with Iodide of Silver, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Nitric Acid neutralized if it be present. Nitrate of Silver
however which has undergone fusion is free from Nitric
Acid.</p>

<p>Weigh out the total quantity of crystals of Nitrate required
for the Bath, and dissolve in about two parts of
water. Then take a quarter of a grain of Iodide of Potassium
to each 100 grains of Nitrate, dissolve in half a
drachm of water, and add to the strong solution; a yellow
deposit of Iodide of Silver first forms, but on stirring is
completely re-dissolved. When the liquid is clear, test for
free Nitric Acid by dropping in a piece of blue litmus-paper.
If at the expiration of two minutes the paper
appears <i>reddened</i>, Nitric Acid is present, to neutralize
which, add solution of Potash or Carbonate of Soda (not
Ammonia) until a distinct turbidity, remaining after agitation,
is produced (an excess does no harm). Then
dilute down the concentrated solution with the remaining
portion of the water, stirring all the time, and filter out
the milky deposit. If the liquid does not at first run clear,
it will probably do so on passing it again through the same
filter.</p>

<p>Lastly, add the Acetic Acid (previously tested for impurities,
see Part III.) and the Alcohol to the filtered
liquid.</p>

<p>As the bulk of the Bath becomes lessened by use, fill
it up with a solution containing 40 grains of Nitrate to
the ounce, which will be found sufficient to maintain the
strength nearly at the original point.</p>

<p>The common practice of occasionally dropping Ammonia
or Potash into the solution, to remove Nitric Acid
liberated by free Iodine in the Collodion, is not recommended
(see <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>).</p>

<p>When the Bath becomes old, and yields Positives which
are highly intense or stained, and slightly foggy, with a
deficiency of half-tone, it will be advisable to precipitate
it with a Chloride and prepare a new one.</p>

<p>In all these formulæ, if distilled water is not at hand,
read the directions in the Vocabulary, Part III., Article
"Water," for the best substitute.</p>

<p><i>Remarks upon these Formulæ.</i>&mdash;<i>Formula No. 1</i> is the
most simple, since the solution can be used <i>as a Bath</i>, the
same portion being employed many times successively. If
it acts too rapidly, lessen the proportion of Sulphate of
Iron. An addition of Nitric Acid, half a minim to the
ounce, makes the image whiter and more metallic; but if
too much is used, the development proceeds irregularly,
and spangles of Silver are formed.</p>

<p>The Alcohol and Acetic Acid render the development
uniform by causing the solution of Protosulphate to combine
more readily with the film. The latter also has an
effect in whitening the image and increasing its brightness.</p>

<p>Solution of Sulphate of Iron becomes red on keeping,
from a gradual formation of <i>per</i>salt. When it is too weak,
add more of the Protosulphate. The muddy deposit which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
settles to the bottom of the Bath is metallic Silver, reduced
from the soluble Nitrate upon the plates.</p>

<p>Some operators add pure Nitrate of Potash to this
developing solution, to form a <i>small portion</i> of Protonitrate
of Iron. It is said to improve the colour slightly.
The proportions are 10 grains of Nitrate of Potash to
about 14 or 15 grains of Protosulphate of Iron.</p>

<p><i>Formula No. 2.</i>&mdash;In this formula, if the colour of the
image is not sufficiently white, try the effect of increasing
the amount of Nitric Acid slightly. On the other hand,
if the development is imperfect in parts, and patches of a
green colour are seen, use <i>three grains</i> of Pyrogallic Acid
to the ounce, with less Nitric Acid. A few drops of
Nitrate of Silver solution added to the Pyrogallic, immediately
before use, will augment the energy of development
when blue and green spots occur.</p>

<p><i>Formula No. 3</i>, or Protonitrate of Iron, does not require
any addition of Acid; but it will be advisable, in
some cases, to add to it a few drops of Nitrate of Silver
immediately before developing. It gives a bright metallic
image, resembling that obtained by adding Nitric Acid to
Protosulphate of Iron.</p>

<p>The following process is commonly followed for preparing
Protonitrate of Iron:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of Nitrate of Baryta 300 grains;&mdash;powder and
dissolve by the aid of heat in three ounces of water. Then
throw in by degrees, with constant stirring, crystallized
Sulphate of Iron, <i>powdered</i>, 320 grains. Continue to stir
for about five or ten minutes. Allow to cool, and filter
from the white deposit, which is the insoluble Sulphate of
Baryta.</p>

<p>In place of Nitrate of Baryta, the Nitrate of Lead may
be used (Sulphate of Lead being an insoluble salt), but the
quantity required will be different. The atomic weights
of Nitrate of Baryta and Nitrate of Lead are as 131 to
166; consequently 300 grains of the former are equivalent
to 380 grains of the latter.</p>

<p>Cyanide of Potassium is usually preferred to Hyposulphite
of Soda for fixing direct Positives; it is less liable to
injure the purity of the white colour. The percentage of
<i>Carbonate of Potash</i> in commercial Cyanide of Potassium
is so variable that no exact directions can be given for the
formula. It is best however to use it rather dilute&mdash;of
such a strength that the plate is cleared gradually in from
half a minute to a minute.</p>

<p>The solution of Cyanide of Potassium decomposes slowly
on keeping, but it will usually retain its solvent power for
several weeks. In order to escape inconvenience from the
pungent odour evolved by this salt, many employ a vertical
Bath to hold the solution; but in that case the plates
must be carefully washed before fixing, as the Iron salts
hasten the decomposition of the Cyanide.</p>

<p>By a gentle application of heat the corrosive sublimate
dissolves and forms a solution as nearly as possible saturated
at common temperatures. The addition of a portion
of Muriatic Acid enables the water to take up a larger
quantity of Bichloride; but this concentrated solution, at
the same time that it whitens more quickly than the other,
is apt to act unequally upon different parts of the image.</p>

<p>Before applying the Bichloride, the image is to be fixed
and the plate well washed. Either the Protosulphate of
Iron or the Pyrogallic Acid with Acetic (<a href="#Page_223">p. 223</a>) may be
used for the development; but the whitening process is
more rapid and uniform in the latter case.</p>

</table>

<p>When the temperature of the Nitro-Sulphuric Acid
used in making the Pyroxyline is high (140° to 155°), it
often happens that the Collodion is too fluid with 4 grains
of soluble paper to the ounce, and forms a blue transparent
film of Iodide on dipping the plate in the Bath. In that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
case, increase the quantity of Pyroxyline from 4 grains to
6, or even to 8 grains to each ounce.</p>

<p>If the Collodion is glutinous, and produces a wavy surface,
with less than 4 grains of Pyroxyline to the ounce, it
is probable that the Alcohol is too weak, or that the soluble
Cotton is badly made.</p>

<p>If flakes of Iodide of Silver are seen loose upon the
surface of the film, and falling away into the Bath, the
Collodion is over-iodized, and it will be impossible to obtain
a good picture.</p>

<p>After the Collodion has been employed to coat a number
of plates, the relative proportions of Alcohol and Ether
contained in it become changed, from the superior volatility
of the latter fluid: when it ceases to flow readily,
and gives a more dense film than usual, thin it down by
the addition of a little rectified Ether.</p>

<p>In dissolving the Pyroxyline, any fibrous or flocculent
matter which resists the action of the Ether, must be allowed
to subside, the clear portion being decanted for use.
The Iodide of Potassium is to be finely powdered, and digested
with the spirit until dissolved; it is better not to
apply any heat. Both Iodide of Ammonium and Iodide
of Cadmium dissolve almost immediately, if the salts are
pure.</p>

<p>The Collodion must be kept in a cool and dark place.
When prepared with Iodide of Ammonium or Potassium
it becomes at length high coloured and insensitive. The
free Iodine may then be removed by a strip of pure zinc
or silver-foil.</p>

<p>When sensitiveness is not an object, many prefer working
with an old, coloured Collodion, finding that it gives
more intensity. It has been shown at <a href="#Page_97">page 97</a> that a peculiar
change takes place in Collodion after iodizing, by
which the intensity of the image is increased.</p>

<p><i>Directions for using Glycyrrhizine in Collodion.</i>&mdash;The
action of this material has been described at <a href="#Page_114">page 114</a>. The
Collodion should be iodized with the Iodide of Cadmium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
only, or with a mixture of the Iodides and Bromides of the
alkalies. The condition which calls for the employment of
Glycyrrhizine is that often found in a newly made and
rather glutinous Collodion, viz. sensitiveness of film, with
good half-tones, but insufficient intensity in the high
lights. Dissolve the Glycyrrhizine in Alcohol (not Methylated)
in the proportion of 5 grains to the ounce: this solution
may perhaps keep unchanged for three or four
months. To each ounce of the Collodion add from one to
four drops, and expose in the Camera a few seconds longer
than before. The effect of the Glycyrrhizine upon the Collodion
may not be fully produced immediately; if so, the
fluid must be set aside for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><i>Use of Nitro-glucose in Collodion.</i>&mdash;Nitro-glucose is a
substance analogous to Pyroxyline, but more unstable.
When added to Collodion iodized with the alkaline Iodides,
it slowly decomposes, liberates Iodine, lessens the sensitiveness
to a certain extent, and confers intensity. Like
Glycyrrhizine, it may be used to remedy feebleness of the
image, and to give opacity to the blacks. Prepare the Nitro-glucose
by the directions given in the Vocabulary, Part
III. Dissolve twenty grains in an ounce of pure spirit,
and agitate with powdered chalk to remove free acid.
Add from five to eight drops to each ounce of Collodion.
In a few days, more or less, according to temperature, the
Collodion will deepen in colour, and will be found on trial
to produce a more vigorous picture.</p>

<p><i>Collodion for hot Climates.</i>&mdash;In this case the Iodide of
Ammonium should be avoided, as unstable and prone to
change colour. Iodide of Cadmium may be substituted,
which has been shown to remain quite colourless when
dissolved in Alcohol and Ether.</p>

<p>Collodion iodized with the Iodide of Potassium will
usually keep for about six weeks or two months; but no
certain rule can be given, much depending upon the condition
of the Ether and the heat of the weather.</p>

<p>Plain Collodion may retain its properties unimpaired for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
five or six months, sometimes much longer; but there
is a tendency to a formation of the acid principle (<a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>);
and hence, on the addition of an alkaline Iodide to old
Collodion, the coloration is commonly very rapid. The
structure of the transparent film may also be injured by
keeping plain Collodion for too long a time.</p>

<p>Photographers who wish to operate with Collodion in
hot climates will find it advantageous to carry with them
the prepared Pyroxyline and the spirituous solvents, observing
that the bottles are carefully <i>luted</i>, and that a
bubble of air is left in the neck of each, to allow for the
necessary expansion, which might otherwise burst the
glass or force out the stopper.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE NITRATE BATH.</p>

<p>This solution may be prepared by the same formula as

<p>In place of Distilled Water, pure Rain-Water may be
used (see Part III., Art. "Water").</p>

<p>The quantity of Acetic Acid required will vary with
the strength of the Acid and the temperature of the atmosphere.
An excess enables the manipulator to cover the
plate more easily before the action begins, but when the
picture is taken in a dull light, is apt to give a bluish, inky
hue to the image. In cold weather, use less of the Acetic
and twice the quantity of Pyrogallic Acid. With Collodion
prepared from Spirits nearly anhydrous, and iodized
with Iodide of Cadmium, the full quantity of Acetic Acid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
will be required, as there is sometimes a little difficulty in
making the developer flow up to the edge of the film.</p>

<p>If the image cannot be rendered sufficiently black, two or
three minims of the Nitrate Bath solution may be added to
each drachm towards the end of the development.</p>

<p>If the solution be kept for some time after its first preparation,
it becomes brown and discoloured. In this state
it will still develope the image, but is less likely to give a
clear and vigorous picture. A solution of Pyrogallic Acid
in Acetic Acid will keep for many weeks, and may be diluted
down when required for use.</p>

<p class="caption3">MANIPULATIONS OF THE COLLODION PROCESS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">These</span> may be classed under five heads:&mdash;Cleaning the
Plates.&mdash;Coating with Iodide of Silver.&mdash;Exposure in the
Camera.&mdash;Developing the image.&mdash;Fixing the image.&mdash;In

taking stereoscopic and microscopic photographs.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">CLEANING THE GLASS PLATES.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in selecting glass for use in Photography.
The ordinary window-glass is inferior, having
scratches upon the surface, each of which may cause an
irregular action of the developing fluid; and the squares
are seldom flat, so that they are apt to be broken in compression
during the printing process.</p>

<p>The patent plate answers better than any other description
of glass; but if it cannot be procured, the "flatted
crown glass" may be substituted.</p>

<p>Before washing the glasses, each square should be roughened
on the edges by means of a file or a sheet of emery-paper;
or more simply, by drawing the edges of two plates
across each other. If this precaution be omitted, the
fingers are liable to injury, and the Collodion film may
contract and separate from the sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>In cleaning glasses, it is not sufficient, as a rule, to wash
them simply with water; other liquids are required to remove
<i>grease</i>, if present. A cream of Tripoli powder and
Spirits of Wine, with a little Ammonia added, is commonly
employed. A tuft of cotton is dipped in this mixture, and
the glasses are well rubbed with it for a few minutes. They
are then rinsed in plain water and wiped dry with a cloth.</p>

<p>The cloths used for cleaning glasses should be kept expressly
for that purpose; they are best made of a material
sold as fine "diaper," and very free from flocculi and
loosely-adhering fibres. They are not to be washed <i>in
soap and water</i>, but always in pure water or in water containing
a little Carbonate of Soda.</p>

<p>After wiping the glass carefully, complete the process
by polishing with an old silk handkerchief, avoiding contact
with the skin of the hand. Some object to <i>silk</i>, as
tending to render the glass electrical, and so to attract
particles of dust, but in practice no inconvenience will be
experienced from this source.</p>

<p>Before deciding that the glass is clean, hold it in an angular
position and <i>breathe</i> upon it. The importance of attending
to this simple rule will be at once seen by referring
to the remarks made at <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>. In the Honey preservative
and Collodio-Albumen processes it is especially needful
that the glasses should be thoroughly cleaned, on account
of the tendency which the film has to become loosened or
to blister during the development and washings. Caustic
Potash, sold by the druggists under the name of "Liquor
Potassæ," is very efficacious, or in place of it, a warm
solution of "washing Soda" (Carbonate of Soda). Liquor
Potassæ, being a caustic and alkaline liquid, softens the
skin and dissolves it; it must therefore be diluted with
about four parts of water and applied to the glass by means
of a cylindrical roll of flannel. After wetting both sides
thoroughly, allow the glass to stand for a time until several
have been treated in the same way; then wash with water
and rub dry in a cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of an alkaline solution is usually sufficient to
clean the glass, but some plates are dotted on the surface
with small white specks, not removable by Potash. These
specks may consist of hard particles of <i>Carbonate of Lime</i>,
and when such is the case they dissolve readily in a dilute
acid,&mdash;Oil of Vitriol, with about four parts of water added,
or dilute Nitric Acid.</p>

<p>The objection to the use of Nitric Acid is, that if allowed
to come in contact with the dress, it produces stains
which cannot be removed unless <i>immediately</i> treated with
an alkali. A drop of Ammonia should be applied to the
spot before it becomes yellow and faded.</p>

<p>When Positives are to be taken, it is advisable to use
additional care in preparing the glass, and especially so
with pale transparent films and neutral, Nitrate Bath.</p>

<p>After a glass has been once coated with Collodion, it is
not necessary in cleaning it a second time to use anything
but pure water; but if the film has been allowed to harden
and become dry, possibly dilute Oil of Vitriol or Cyanide
of Potassium may be required to remove stains.</p>

<p>When glasses have been repeatedly used in photography
they often become at length so dull and stained, that it is
better to reject them.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">COATING THE PLATE WITH THE COLLODIO-IODIDE OF SILVER.</p>

<p>This part of the process, with that which follows, must
be conducted in a room from which chemical rays of light
are excluded. It is inferred therefore that the operator
has provided himself with an apartment of that kind.</p>

<p>The most simple plan of preparing the room is to nail a
treble thickness of yellow calico completely over the window,
or a part of it, the remainder being darkened. To
this a single thickness of a waterproof material made by
coating linen with gutta-percha may be added as a further
security against the entrance of white light, the smallest
pencil of which admitted into the room would cause fogging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>It is often convenient to illuminate by means of a candle
screened by yellow glass. A dark orange yellow, approaching
to brown, is more impervious to chemical rays than a
lighter canary-yellow. Lamps suitable for the purpose are
sold by the manufacturers of apparatus and chemicals.</p>

<p>Before coating the plate with Collodion, see that the
fluid is perfectly clear and transparent, and that all particles
have settled to the bottom; also that the neck of the
bottle is free from hard and dry crusts, which, if allowed
to remain, would partially dissolve and produce striæ upon
the film. In taking small portraits and stereoscopic subjects,
these points are of especial importance, and every
picture will be spoiled if they are not attended to.</p>

<p>A useful piece of apparatus for clearing Collodion is
that represented in the following woodcut.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 156px;">
<img src="images/pg216.png" width="156" height="231" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Collodion, having been iodized some hours previously,
is allowed to settle down and become clear in this
bottle; then by gently blowing at the point of the shorter
tube, the small glass siphon is filled, and the fluid drawn off
more closely than could be done by simply pouring from
one bottle to another.</p>

<p>When the Collodion is properly cleared from sediment,
the operator takes a glass plate, previously cleaned, and
wipes it gently with a silk handkerchief, in order to remove
any particles of dust which may have subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
collected. If it be a plate of moderate size, it may be held
by the corners in a horizontal position, between the forefinger
and thumb of the left hand. The Collodion is to be
poured on steadily until a circular pool is formed, extending
nearly to the edges of the glass.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 214px;">
<img src="images/pg217.png" width="214" height="146" alt="" />
</div>

<p>By a slight inclination of the plate the fluid is made to
flow towards the corner marked 1, in the above diagram,
until it nearly touches the thumb by which the glass is
held: from corner 1 it is passed to corner 2, held by the
forefinger; from 2 to 3, and lastly, the excess poured
back into the bottle from the corner marked No. 4. It is
then to be held vertically over the bottle for a moment,
until it <i>nearly</i> ceases to drip, and then, by raising the
thumb a little, the direction of the plate is changed, so
as to cause the diagonal lines to coalesce and produce a
smooth surface. The operation of coating a plate with Collodion
must not be done hurriedly, and nothing is required
to ensure success but steadiness of hand and a sufficiency
of the fluid poured in the first instance upon the plate.</p>

<p>In coating larger plates, the <i>pneumatic</i> holder, which
fixes itself by suction, will be found the most simple and
useful.</p>

<p><i>The Proper Time for immersing the Film in the Bath.</i>&mdash;After
exposing a layer of Collodion to the air for a short
time, the greater part of the Ether evaporates, and leaves
the Pyroxyline in a state in which it is neither wet nor
dry, but receives the impression of the finger without adhering
to it. Photographers term this <i>setting</i>, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
it takes place it is a sign that the time has come for submitting
it to the action of the Bath.</p>

<p>If the film be lowered into the Nitrate before it has set,
the effect is the same as that produced by adding Water
to Collodion. The Pyroxyline is precipitated in part, and
consequently there are cracks, and the developer will not
always run up to the edge of the film. On the other hand,
if it be allowed to become too dry, the Iodide of Silver
does not form perfectly, and the film, on being washed and
brought out to the light, exhibits a peculiar iridescent appearance,
and is paler in some parts than in others.</p>

<p>No rule can be given as to the exact time which ought
to elapse: it varies with the temperature of the atmosphere,
and with the proportions of Ether and of Pyroxyline;
thin Collodion containing but little Alcohol requiring
to be immersed more speedily. Twenty seconds in the
common way, or ten seconds in hot weather, will be found
an average time.</p>

<p>When the plate is ready, rest it upon the glass dipper,
Collodion side uppermost, and lower it into the solution by
a slow and steady movement: if any pause be made, a horizontal
line corresponding to the surface of the liquid will
be formed. Then place the cover upon the vertical trough<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and darken the room, if this has not already been done.
As the presence of white light does no injury to the plate
previous to its immersion in the Bath, it is not necessary
to exclude it during the time of coating with Collodion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Troughs made of gutta-percha, glass, or porcelain are commonly used;
the latter are the best, being quite opaque and not liable to cracks or
leaking.</p></div>

<p>When the plate has remained in the solution about twenty
seconds, lift it partially out two or three times, in order to
wash away the Ether from the surface. An immersion of
one minute to a minute and a half will usually be sufficient;
or two minutes in cold weather, and with Collodion containing
but little Alcohol. Continue to move the plate
until the liquid flows off in a uniform sheet, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
decomposition may be considered to be sufficiently perfect.
The principal impediment in this part of the process lies
in the difficulty with which Ether and Water mix together,
which causes the Collodion surface on its first immersion
to appear oily and covered with streaks. By gentle motion
the Ether is washed away, and a smooth and homogeneous
layer obtained.</p>

<p>The plate is next removed from the dipper, and held
vertically in the hand for a few seconds upon blotting
paper, to drain off as much as possible of the solution of
Nitrate of Silver.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It is then wiped on the back with
filtering-paper, placed in a clean and dry slide, and is
ready for the Camera.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> This blotting-paper must be frequently changed, or stains will
be produced at the lower edge of the plate during the development.</p></div>

<p>The amateur is strongly recommended not to proceed
to take pictures in the Camera until by a little practice he
has succeeded in producing a perfect film which is uniform
in every part and will bear inspection when washed and
brought out to the light.</p>

<p>It should, if properly prepared, present the following appearance:&mdash;Smooth
and uniform, both by reflected and
transmitted light; free from wavy lines or markings such
as would be caused by a glutinous Pyroxyline, and from
opaque dots due to small particles of dust or Iodide of
Silver in suspension in the Collodion.</p>

<p>The evidences of a too rapid immersion in the Bath are
sought for on the side of the plate from which the Collodion
was poured off. This part remains wet longer than
the other, and always suffers the most; horizontal cracks
or marks resembling vegetation are seen, each of which
would cause an irregular action of the developing fluid.
On the other hand, the upper part of the plate must be
examined for the pale colour characteristic of a film
which had become too dry before immersion, since the Collodion
is thinner at that point than at any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4nb">EXPOSURE OF THE PLATE IN THE CAMERA.</p>

<p>After the plate has been rendered sensitive, it should be
exposed and developed with all convenient despatch; the
intensity of the Negatives being, with some Collodion,
materially lessened by neglecting this point (see <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>).</p>

<p>Ascertain that the joints of the Camera are tight in every
part&mdash;that the sensitive plate, when placed in the slide, falls
precisely in the same plane as that occupied by the ground
glass&mdash;and that the chemical and visual foci of the Lens
accurately correspond.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> See the Second Section of this Chapter.</p></div>

<p>Supposing the case of a portrait, next proceed to arrange
the sitter as nearly as possible in a vertical position, that
every part may be equidistant from the lens. Then, an
imaginary line being drawn from the head to the knee,
point the Camera slightly downwards, so that it may stand
at right angles to the line. If this point be neglected the
figure will be liable to be distorted in a manner presently
to be shown (<a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>).</p>

<p>In order to succeed well with portraits, the sitter should
be illuminated by an even, diffused light falling horizontally.
A vertical light causes a deep shadow on the eyes
and makes the hair appear grey: it must therefore be cut
off by a curtain of blue or white calico suspended over the
head. The direct rays of the sun are generally to be
avoided, as causing too great a contrast of light and shade.
This is a point on which the operator must exercise his
judgment. With a feeble Collodion, a better Negative picture
may often be obtained by placing the sitter quite in
the open air, but when the Collodion and Bath are in the
condition for giving great intensity of image, the gradation
of tone will be inferior unless the light be prevented from
falling too strongly upon the face and hands.</p>

<p>In focussing the object, cover the head and the back
part of the Camera with a black cloth, and shift the Lens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
gently until the greatest possible amount of distinctness is
obtained. Then insert the sensitive plate, and having
raised the door of the slide, cover all with a black cloth
during the exposure, as a security against white light finding
entrance at any part excepting through the Lens.</p>

<p>With regard to the proper time for the exposure, so
much depends upon the brightness of the light and the nature
of the Collodion, that it must be left almost entirely
to experience. The following general rules however may
be of use:&mdash;</p>

<p>In a tolerably bright day in the spring or summer
months, and with a newly-mixed Collodion, allow four
seconds for a Positive Portrait, and eight seconds for a
Negative. With a double-combination Lens of large aperture
and short focus, perhaps three seconds, and six seconds,
or even less, may be sufficient.</p>

<p>In the dull winter months, in the smoky atmosphere of
large cities, or when using an old Collodion brown from
free Iodine, multiply these numbers three or four times,
which will be an approximation to the exposure required.
It is by the appearance presented under the influence of
the developer, which will immediately be described, that
the operator ascertains the proper time for exposure to
light.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMAGE.</p>

<p>The details of developing the latent image differ so much
in the case of Positive and Negative pictures, that it is
better to describe the two separately.</p>

<p>The development of direct Positives.&mdash;With Sulphate of
Iron as a developer, it is most simple to develope the image
by immersion. The solution may conveniently be poured
into a vertical trough, such as that used for exciting, and
the plate immersed by means of a glass dipper in the usual
way. Unless the weather be cold, the image makes its appearance
in three or four seconds, and the film is then immediately
washed with clear water. Whilst in the Bath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the plate is kept in gentle motion, and the operator must
not expect to see the image very distinctly, except the
high lights; the shadows, being faint, are partially concealed
by the unaltered Iodide, but they come out during
the fixing. The action of the Sulphate of Iron is stopped
at an early period, or an excess of development will be
incurred. The Bath may be used repeatedly.</p>

<p>In using Pyrogallic Acid or Nitrate of Iron to develope
glass Positives, the plate may be placed upon a levelling-stand,
or held in the hand, or by the pneumatic holder,
and the solution poured on quickly at one corner; by
blowing gently or inclining the hand, as the case may be,
it is scattered evenly over the film before the development
commences.</p>

<p>If any difficulty is experienced in covering a plate evenly
with a strong developer before the action commences, it
may be overcome by using a shallow cell formed by cementing
two or three thicknesses of window-glass on a piece
of patent plate to the depth of a quarter of an inch. The
size of the cell should be only slightly larger than the plate
intended to be developed, that the waste of fluid may be
as little as possible.</p>

<p>The cell is held in the left hand, and the plate being
placed in it, a sufficient quantity of the developer is poured
on at one corner. By a slight inclination, the fluid is
caused to flow in a uniform sheet over the surface of the
film, backwards and forwards. The image starts out
quickly, and the developer is then at once poured off, and
the film washed as before.</p>

<p>It is very important in developing Positives to use a
sufficient quantity of the solution to cover the plate easily;
otherwise oily stains and marks are formed, from the developer
not combining properly with the surface of the
film. For a plate five inches by four, three or four drachms
will be required, and so in proportion for larger sizes.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Positive image after developing,
as a guide to the proper time of exposure.&mdash;When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
plate has been developed, it is washed, fixed, and laid
upon a dark ground, such as a piece of black velvet, for
inspection.</p>

<p>In the case of a portrait, if the features have an unnaturally
black and gloomy appearance, the dark portions
of the drapery, etc., being invisible, the picture has been
<i>under-exposed</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in an over-exposed plate, the face is
usually pale and white, and the drapery misty and indistinct.
Much however in this respect depends upon the
dress of the sitter (see <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>), and the manner in which the
light is thrown; if the upper part of the figure is shaded
too much, the face may perhaps be the last to be seen.
The operator should accustom himself to expend pains
in the preliminary focussing upon the ground glass, and
to ascertain at that time that every part of the object
is equally illuminated. For this reason, pictures taken
in a room are seldom successful; the light falls entirely
upon one side, and hence the shadows are dark and indistinct.</p>

<p><i>The development of Negative Pictures.</i>&mdash;This process
differs in most respects from that of Positives. In the
latter case, there is a tendency to over-develope the image;
but in the former, to stop the action at too early a period;
hence it is common to find Negative Pictures which are
insufficiently developed, and too pale to print well.</p>

<p>In developing Negatives, many operators place the plate
upon a levelling-stand, and distribute the fluid by blowing
gently upon the surface; others prefer holding it in the
hand and pouring the fluid on and off from a glass measure.
The quantity of developer required will be less than that
used for Positives, inasmuch as, if the Acetic Acid be present
in sufficient excess, it is easy to cover the plate before
the action begins. Some Collodion however, especially the
glutinous kind, seems to repel the developer and prevent
it from running up to the edge of the plate. When this
is the case, or when oiliness and stains are produced, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the Bath being old and containing Ether, Alcohol must be
added to the solution of Pyrogallic Acid.</p>

<p>With ordinary Negative Collodion, an addition of Nitrate
of Silver to the developer will often be required; but
the Pyrogallic Acid is to be used alone until the image
has reached its maximum of intensity, which it will do in
a minute or so, according to the temperature of the developing
room. The plate may then be examined leisurely
by placing it in front of, and at some distance from, a sheet
of white paper. If it is not sufficiently black, add about
four drops of the Nitrate Bath to each drachm of developer,
stir well with a glass rod, and continue the action until the
requisite amount of intensity is obtained. When there is
any disposition in the plate to <i>fog</i> towards the end of the
development, it may be obviated by fixing with Cyanide
of Potassium (not Hyposulphite), and then, after a careful
washing, intensifying with Pyrogallic Acid and Nitrate
of Silver in the usual way. The glass which contains the
mixture of Pyrogallic Acid and Nitrate of Silver must be
washed out after each plate, as the black deposit hastens
the discoloration of the fresh solution (<a href="#Page_179">p. 179</a>).</p>

<p><i>Appearance of the Negative image during and after the
reducing process, as a guide to the exposure to light.</i>&mdash;An
under-exposed plate developes slowly. By continuing the
action of the Pyrogallic Acid, the high lights <i>become very
black</i>, but the shadows are invisible, nothing but the
yellow Iodide being seen on those portions of the plate.
After treatment with the Cyanide, the picture shows well
as a Positive, but by transmitted light all the minor details
are invisible; the image is black and white, without
any half-tone.</p>

<p>An over-exposed Negative developes rapidly at first, but
soon begins to blacken slightly at every part of the plate.
After the fixing is completed, nothing can often be seen by
reflected light but a uniform grey surface of metallic Silver,
without any appearance (or, at most, an indistinct one)
of an image. By transmitted light the plate may appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of a red or brown colour, and the image is <i>faint</i> and dull.
The clear parts of the Negative being obscured by the
fogging, and the half-shadows having acted so long as
nearly to overtake the lights, there is a want of proper
<i>contrast;</i> hence the over-exposed plate is the exact converse
of the under-exposed, where the contrast between
lights and shadows is too well marked, from the absence of
intermediate tints.</p>

<p>A Negative which has received the proper amount of
exposure, usually possesses the following characters after
the development is completed:&mdash;The image is partially
but not fully seen by reflected light. In the case of a
portrait, any dark portions of drapery show well as a Positive,
but the features of the sitter are scarcely to be discerned.
The plate has a general aspect as of fogging <i>about
to commence</i>, but not actually established. By transmitted
light the figure is bright, and appears to stand out from
the glass: the dark shadows are clear, without any misty
deposit of metallic Silver; the high lights black <i>almost</i>
to complete opacity. The <i>colour</i> of the image however
varies much with the state of the Bath and Collodion
and with the brightness of the light.</p>

<p>The remarks already made under the head of Positives,
apply equally well to Negatives; that is, it will be difficult
to secure gradation of tone, unless the object be <i>equally</i>
illuminated, without any strong contrast of light and shade.
Hence the direct rays of the sun are, as a rule, to be avoided,
and curtains, etc., employed when practicable.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">FIXING AND VARNISHING THE IMAGE.</p>

<p>After the development is completed, and the plate has
been carefully washed by a stream of water, it may be
brought out to the light and treated with the Hyposulphite
or Cyanide, until the unaltered Iodide is entirely
cleared off. Some use a Bath for the Cyanide; but it is
doubtful whether much saving is effected by doing so.
The plate is again to be carefully washed after the fixing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and especially if Hyposulphite of Soda be used. Three or
four minutes in running water will not be too long, or the
glass may be left in a dish of water for an hour or two.
If such precautions are neglected, crystals form on drying,
and the image is injured.</p>

<p>Collodion pictures should be protected by a coat of varnish,
both Negatives and Positives having been known to
fade when exposed to damp air without any covering (see
<a href="#Page_166">p. 166</a>). To prepare transparent varnish. Amber may be
dissolved in Chloroform according to Dr. Diamond's formula;&mdash;about
80 grains of amber-beads or pipe-stems should
be digested with one ounce of the Chloroform, and the
clear portion separated by filtration. It may be poured
on the plate in the same manner as Collodion, and dries
up speedily into a hard and transparent layer. The Spirit
Varnish ordinarily sold for Negatives requires the aid of
heat to prevent the gum from chilling as it dries; the
plate is first warmed gently and the varnish poured on and
off in the usual way; it is then, whilst still dripping, held
to the fire until the Spirit has evaporated. A few trials
will render the operation easy to perform. White Lac
dissolved in strong Alcohol or in Benzole has also been
recommended for clear varnish.</p>

<p>Direct Positives are to be varnished, first with a layer
of transparent varnish, and then with black japan. Suggett's
patent jet is sometimes employed, but it has a disagreeable
smell, and is apt to crack on drying. The best
black japan used by coachmakers is more elastic and less
liable to crack. Asphalt (4 oz.) dissolved in mineral
Naphtha (10 oz.), with the addition of 30 grains of Caoutchouc
dissolved in half an ounce of the same menstruum,
is also said to stand well. A third formula contains black
sealing-wax dissolved in Alcohol. In either case it will be
best to apply first a layer of clear varnish to the film, and
afterwards the black varnish, which should combine with
the other without dissolving it.</p>

<p>Positives whitened with Bichloride of Mercury are injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
by varnishing; they must therefore be backed up
with black velvet, or Japan laid upon the opposite side of
the glass. Many prefer taking the picture upon coloured
glass, using only a layer of clear varnish; but in this case
the Collodion side being left uppermost, the image is necessarily
reversed.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Directions for the use of Photographic Lenses.</i></p>

<p>Those who are comparatively unacquainted with the
science of optics require simple rules to guide them in the
choice of a photographic lens, and in the proper mode of
using it.</p>

<p>Two kinds of Achromatic lenses are sold, the Portrait
lens and the View lens; the former of which is constructed
to admit a large volume of light, for the purpose of copying
living objects, etc.</p>

<p>A convenient-sized Camera for small portraits is "the
half-plate" with a lens of about 2&frac14; inches diameter, and
giving a tolerably flat field on a surface of 5 inches by 4.
Much however in this respect will depend upon the quality
of the glass and also upon its focal length; a short focus
lens taking a picture more quickly, but giving a smaller
image, and a field which is misty towards the edge. There
is also a great tendency to <i>distortion</i> of the image in portrait
lenses of large aperture and short focus, such as those
employed for operating in a dull light.</p>

<p>The "whole plate" portrait lens may be expected to cover
6&frac12; by 4&frac34; inches, and has a diameter of about 3&frac14; inches.
It will take larger pictures than the last, but not necessarily
in a shorter time; since, although the aperture for
admitting the light is larger, the focal length is proportionately
greater and the light less condensed.</p>

<p>The "quarter-plate" portrait lens of 1&frac14; inch diameter is
useful for stereoscopic subjects and small portraits; which
are usually more sharply defined when taken with a small
lens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance at which the Camera is to be placed from
the sitter in taking a portrait, will depend upon the focal
length of the lens. The effect of bringing the Camera
nearer is to add to the size of the image, but at the same
time to increase the chance of distortion; hence with every
lens of full aperture, there is a practical limit to the size
of picture which can be taken.</p>

<p>When it is required to obtain a large image with a
small lens, a stop with a central aperture (which may be
readily made of a piece of circular cardboard blackened
with Indian ink) must be placed in front of the lens. This
will diminish the amount of light, but will render the
picture more distinct towards the edge, and bring a variety
of objects at different distances into focus at the same
time. With a stop attached, the lens may also be brought
nearer to the object without distorting.</p>

<p>With regard to this subject of the distortion often produced
by lenses, observe particularly, that with the portrait
combination of full aperture, and especially when the
powers of the glass are rather strained by its being advanced
too near to the sitter,&mdash;all objects near to the lens
will be <i>magnified</i>, and those more removed will appear diminished;
hence, as the position of the sitter is never quite
vertical, the Camera must be inclined a little <i>downwards</i>,
or the hands and feet will be enlarged, the figure in fact
becoming pyramidal with the base below; whereas on the
other hand, if the inclination of the Camera be too great,
the head and forehead will be enlarged, and the figure becomes
a pyramid with the base above.</p>

<p>When groups are taken, arrange the objects as near as
possible equidistant from the lens, and use a stop if practicable.
Long-focus lenses are the best for this purpose,
allowing the Photograph to be taken further off, and giving
a greater variety of objects in focus at the same time.</p>

<p>Portrait lenses may often be advantageously substituted
for View lenses in copying objects of still life which are
<i>badly lighted</i>. The aperture of the lens being large, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Negative can be obtained with an amount of light which
would not suffice if a small stop were used. On the other
hand, if the light be unusually bright, the lens of full aperture
is always the most likely, from its extent of reflecting
surface, to produce a misty and indistinct image. Hence
the object should be well backed up with some neutral
colour, or, if that cannot be done, a pasteboard funnel, projecting
about a foot and a half, may be fastened in front of
the lens, in order to exclude rays of light not immediately
concerned in the formation of the image. If the lens were
turned towards distant objects brightly illuminated, and a
portion of sky included, there would probably be diffused
light, and consequent fogging of the plate on the application
of the developer. This effect will also invariably
follow if the sun's rays be allowed to fall directly upon
the glass.</p>

<p><i>Directions for finding the Plane at which the Sharpest
Image can be obtained.</i>&mdash;Non-Achromatic Lenses are understood
by all to require correction for the chemical focus;
but it is usually said of the compound glasses, that their
two foci correspond. The amateur is recommended, in
order to avoid disappointment, to test the accuracy of this
statement, and also to see that his Camera is constructed
with care. To do this, proceed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>First ascertain that the prepared sensitive plate falls
precisely in the plane occupied by the ground glass. Suspend
a newspaper or a small engraving at the distance
of about three feet from the Camera, and focus the letters
occupying the centre of the field; then insert the slide,
with a square of <i>ground glass</i> substituted for the ordinary
plate (the rough surface of the glass looking inwards), and
observe if the letters are still distinct. In place of the
ground glass, a transparent plate with a square of silver-paper
which has been oiled or wetted, may be used, but
the former is preferable.</p>

<p>If the result of this trial seems to show that the Camera
is good, proceed to test the correctness of the Lens.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Take a Positive Photograph with the full aperture of the
portrait Lens, the central letters of the newspaper being
carefully focussed as before. Then examine at what part of
the plate the greatest amount of distinctness of outline is
to be found. It will sometimes happen, that whereas the
exact centre was focussed visually, the letters on a spot
midway between the centre and edge are the sharpest in
the Photograph. In that case the chemical focus is longer
than the other, and by a distance equivalent to, but in the
opposite direction of, the space which the ground glass has
to be moved, in order to define those particular letters
sharply to the eye.</p>

<p>When the chemical focus is the shorter of the two, the
letters in the Photograph are indistinct at every portion of
the plate; the experiment must therefore be repeated, the
lens being shifted an eighth of an inch or less. Indeed it
will be proper to take many Photographs at minute variations
of focal distance before the capabilities of the lens
will be fully shown.</p>

<p>The object of finding the point at which the sharpest
image is obtained will also be assisted by placing several
small figures in different planes and focussing those in the
centre. This being done, if the more distant figures come
out distinctly in the Photograph, the chemical focus is <i>longer</i>
than the Visual, or <i>vice versâ</i> when the nearest ones are
most sharply defined.</p>

<p><i>The Single Achromatic Lens.</i>&mdash;A useful lens for landscape
Photography is one of about 3 inches diameter and
15 inches focal length, which may be expected to cover a
field of 10 inches by 8. With the lens, stops are supplied
of various diameters, the largest of which will be useful in
dull weather; the smaller when the field is required to be
rendered sharp to the very edge.</p>

<p>The stop is arranged at a certain distance in front of the
lens, and must not be moved. If it were brought close
up to the glass, the field would not be so flat; the effect
being then the same as that of a stop placed in front of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Portrait Lens, viz. simply to cut off the outside portion of
the glass.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In taking Photographs of architectural and other subjects
with vertical outlines, it is very important to have the
Camera placed perfectly horizontal; since, if it be inclined
either upwards or downwards, the perpendiculars will be
destroyed and the object will appear of a pyramidal form,
falling inwards or outwards, as before shown. It is convenient
to rule the ground focussing glass with a number
of parallel lines in both directions, which enables the operator
at once to see that the position of the instrument is
correct.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION III.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Mode of copying Engravings, Etchings, etc.</i></p>

<p>The engraving to be Photographed should be removed
from its frame (the glass causing irregular reflection) and
suspended vertically and in a reversed position, in a good
diffused light. A black cloth may be placed behind the
picture with advantage if any surface likely to reflect light
be presented to the lens.</p>

<p>The Camera must be fixed immovably, so as not to vibrate
in the least degree when the cap of the lens is taken
off. It should be pointed at right angles to the picture,
and the focus determined in the ordinary way. Either a
portrait or a single lens may be used, with a diaphragm
sufficiently small to render the image distinct up to the
edge.</p>

<p>It is not desirable to employ too thin a Collodion, since
perfect opacity of the darkest parts of the Negative is essential.
An old Collodion containing free Iodine is better
than a contractile Collodion, as giving a more intense and
clear image. Pure Collodion iodized with Iodide of Cadmium,
if found wanting in intensity, may be at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
rendered fit for use in copying engravings by adding Glycyrrhizine
(<a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>), until the dark parts of the negative become
very opaque, and subsequently softening the excessive
hardness, if necessary, by dropping alcoholic solution of
Iodine into the Collodion until it reaches a straw-yellow
tint. A second formula useful in iodizing Collodion for a
similar purpose is as follows.</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Iodide of Potassium</td>
  <td class="tdr">4</td>
  <td class="tdl">grains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Bromide of Potassium</td>
  <td class="tdr">1</td>
  <td class="tdl">grain.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This, with addition of Glycyrrhizine, will give a very
black image.</p>

<p>Etchings, diagrams, and drawings with pencil or ink,
without much middle-tint, if on thin paper, are easily copied
without the aid of the Camera, by simply laying the
sketch upon a sheet of Negative Paper, exposing for a brief
time to the light, and developing with Gallic Acid. This
yields a Negative which is employed for printing Positives
in the usual way. Full directions on this subject will be
found in the Second Section of the following Chapter.</p>

<p>A more simple plan, and one which will succeed when
great delicacy is not required, consists in laying the sketch
upon a sheet of Positive printing paper (a highly salted
paper will be the best, as giving most intensity) and exposing
to the light until a copy is obtained. All the details
are faithfully rendered in this way, but it is sometimes
difficult to obtain a Negative sufficiently black to
yield a <i>vigorous</i> print.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION IV.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Rules for taking Stereoscopic Photographs.</i></p>

<p>Binocular pictures of a large size, for the reflecting Stereoscope,
may be taken with an ordinary View lens of
about 15 inches focus. The ground glass of the Camera
having been ruled with cross lines in the manner described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
at <a href="#Page_231">page 231</a>, the position of some prominent object is marked
upon one of the lines with a pencil, and the first view is
taken. The stand is then moved laterally to the proper
distance, and the Camera adjusted to its second position
by shifting it until the marked object occupies the same
place as before. The distance between the two positions
should be about one foot when the foreground of the picture
is twenty-five feet from the instrument, or four feet
when it is at thirty or forty yards. But, as before shown
at <a href="#Page_71">page 71</a>, this rule is not to be followed implicitly, much
depending upon the character of the picture and the effect
desired.</p>

<p>Photographs for the lenticular Stereoscope are taken
with small lenses of about 4&frac12; inches focus. For portraits,
a Camera may advantageously be fitted with two double-combination
lenses, of 1&frac34; inches diameter, exactly equal
in focal length and in rapidity of action. The caps are
removed simultaneously, and the pictures impressed at the
same instant. The centres of the lenses may be separated
by three inches when the Camera is placed at about six
feet from the sitter, or four inches when the distance is
increased to eight feet.</p>

<p>Pictures taken with a binocular Camera of this kind, require
to be mounted in a reversed position to that which
they occupy on the glass: for since the image of the
Camera is <i>inverted</i>, when it is turned round and made
erect, the right-hand picture will necessarily stand on the
left side, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Latimer Clark has devised an arrangement for taking
stereoscopic pictures with a single Camera, which is
exceedingly ingenious. Its most important feature is a
contrivance for rapidly moving the Camera in a lateral
direction without disturbing the position of the image upon
the ground glass. This will be understood by a reference
to the following woodcut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/pg234.png" width="298" height="270" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"A strongly-framed Camera-stand carries a flat table,
about 20 inches wide by 16, furnished with the usual
adjustments. Upon this are laid two flat bars of wood in the
direction of the object, and parallel, and about the width
of the Camera asunder. They are 18 inches in length;
their front ends carry stout pins, which descend into the
table and form centres upon which they turn. Their opposite
ends also carry similar pins, but these are directed
upwards, and fit into two corresponding holes in the tail-board
of the Camera.</p>

<p>"Now when the Camera is placed upon these pins, and
moved to and fro laterally, the whole system exactly resembles
the common parallel ruler. The two bars form
the guides, and the Camera, although capable of free lateral
motion, always maintains a parallel position. In this
condition of things it is only suited to take stereoscopic
pictures of an object at an infinite distance; but to make
it move in an arc, <i>converging</i> on an object at any nearer
distance, it is only necessary to make the two guide-bars
approximate at their nearer end so as to converge slightly
towards the object; and by a few trials some degree of
convergence will be readily found at which the image will
remain as it were <i>fixed</i> on the focussing glass while the
Camera is moved to and fro. To admit of this adjustment,
one of the pins descends through a Slot in the table and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
carries a clamping-screw, by means of which it is readily
fixed in any required position.</p>

<p>"In order however to render the motion of the Camera
smoother, it is advisable not to place it directly upon the
two guides, but to interpose two thin slips of wood, lying
across them at right angles, beneath the front and back of
the Camera respectively (and which may be fixed to the
Camera if preferred), and to dust the surfaces with powdered
soap-stone or French chalk."</p>

<p>In addition to this arrangement for moving the Camera
laterally, the <i>slide</i> for holding the sensitive plates must be
modified from the common form. It is oblong in shape,
and being about ten or eleven inches long, requires some
little adaptation to fit it to the end of an ordinary Camera.
The glasses are cut to about 6&frac34; inches by 3&frac14;; and when
coated with Iodide of Silver, the two images are impressed
side by side, the plate being shifted laterally about 2&frac12;
inches, at the same time and in the same direction as the
Camera itself.</p>

<p>The operation of taking a portrait is thus performed.
The focus having been adjusted for both positions, and the
Camera and the slide both drawn to the left-hand, the
door is raised and the plate exposed; the Camera and the
slide are then shifted to the right-hand, and the plate in
its new position having been again exposed, the door is
closed and the operation completed.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Pictures taken with this instrument do not require to
be reversed in mounting, the left picture being purposely
formed on the right-hand side of the glass.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION V.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>On the Photographic delineation of Microscopic objects.</i></p>

<p>Many specimens of Micro-photography which have been
exhibited are exceedingly elaborate and beautiful; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
their production is not difficult to one thoroughly acquainted
with the use of the Microscope and with the
manipulations of the Collodion Process. It is important
however to possess a good apparatus, and to have it properly
arranged.</p>

<p>The object-glass of the ordinary compound Microscope
is the only part actually required in Photography, but it
is useful to retain the <i>body</i> for the sake of the adjustments,
and the mirrors used in the illumination. The <i>eye-piece</i>
however, which simply magnifies the image formed by the
object-glass, is not necessary, since the same effect of enlargement
may be obtained by lengthening out the dark
chamber, and throwing the image further off.</p>

<p><i>Arrangement of the Apparatus.</i>&mdash;The Microscope is
placed with its body in a horizontal position, and the eye-piece
being removed, a tube of paper, properly blackened
in the interior, or lined with black velvet, is inserted into
the instrument, to prevent irregular reflection of light from
the sides.</p>

<p>A dark chamber of about two feet in length, having at
one end an aperture for the insertion of the eye-piece end
of the body, and at the other a groove for carrying the
slide containing the sensitive plate, is then attached; care
being taken to stop all crevices likely to admit diffused
light. An ordinary Camera may be employed as the dark
chamber, the lens being removed, and the body lengthened
out if required by a conical tube of gutta-percha, made to
fasten into the flange of the lens in front. The whole apparatus
should be placed exactly in a straight line, that the
ground glass used in focussing may fall at right angles to
the axis of the Microscope.</p>

<p>The length of the chamber, measuring from the object-glass,
may be from two to three feet, according to the size
of image required; but if extended beyond this, the pencil
of light transmitted by the object-glass is diffused over too
large a surface, and a faint and unsatisfactory picture is
the result. The object should be illuminated by sunlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
if it can be obtained, but a bright diffused daylight will
succeed with low-power glasses, and especially when Positives
are taken. Employ the concave mirror for reflecting
the light on the object in the latter case; but in the former
the <i>plane mirror</i> is the best, except with powers exceeding
a quarter of an inch, and of large angular aperture.</p>

<p>The image upon the ground glass should appear bright
and distinct, and the field of a circular form and evenly
illuminated; when this is the case, all is ready for inserting
the sensitive plate.</p>

<p>The time of exposure must be varied according to the intensity
of the light, the sensibility of the Collodion, and the
degree of magnifying power; a few seconds to a minute
will be about the extremes; but minute directions are not
required, as the operator, if a good Photographer, will easily
ascertain the proper time for exposing (see <a href="#Page_224">page 224</a>).</p>

<p>At this point a difficulty will probably occur from the
plane of the chemical focus not corresponding, as a rule,
with that of the visual focus. This arises from the fact
that the object-glasses of Microscopes are "over-corrected"
for colour, in order to compensate for a little chromatic
aberration in the eye-piece. The violet rays, in consequence
of the over-correction, are projected <i>beyond</i> the
yellow, and hence the focus of chemical action is further
from the glass than the visible image.</p>

<p>The allowance may be made by shifting the sensitive
plate, or, what amounts to the same thing, by removing the
object-glass a little <i>away</i> from the object with the fine
adjustment screw; the latter is the most convenient. The
exact distance must be determined by careful experiment
for each glass; but it is greatest with the low powers, and
decreases as they ascend.</p>

<p>Mr. Shadbolt gives the following as a guide:&mdash;"An inch
and a half objective of Smith and Beck's make required
to be shifted <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th of an inch, or two turns of <i>their</i> fine
adjustment; a <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>rds of an inch, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>200</sub>th of an inch, or
half a turn; and a <sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub>ths of an inch, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>th of an inch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
or about two divisions of the adjustment. With the &frac14;th
and higher powers, the difference between the foci was so
small as to be practically unimportant."</p>

<p>There is also reason to think that the <i>kind of light</i>
employed has an influence upon the separation of the
foci. Mr. Delves finds that with sunlight the difference
between them is very small even with the low powers, and
inappreciable with the higher; whereas in using diffused
daylight which has undergone a previous reflection from
white clouds, it is considerable.</p>

<p>The object-glasses of the same maker, and particularly
those of different makers, also vary much; so that it will
be necessary to test each glass separately, and to register
the allowance which is required.</p>

<p>Having found the chemical focus, the principal difficulty
has been overcome, and the remaining steps are the same
in every respect as for ordinary Collodion Photographs.</p>

<p>To those who cannot devote their time to Photography
during the day, Mr. Shadbolt's observations on the use of
artificial light may be of service. He employs <i>Camphine</i>,
which gives a whiter flame than gas, or a moderator lamp;
placing the source of light in the focus of a plano-convex
lens of 2&frac12; to 3 inches diameter (the flat side towards the
lamp), and condensing the parallel rays so obtained on
the object, by a second lens of about 1&frac12;-inch diameter and
3-inch focus.</p>

<p>This mode of illumination, being feeble in chemical rays,
is best adapted for object-glasses of low power. The exposure
required to produce a Negative impression with the
one-inch glass may be from three to five minutes. As the
sensitive plate would be liable to become dry during that
time, it is recommended to coat it with some preservative
solution by the modes described in the sixth Chapter. Mr.
Crookes having lately shown that the Bromide of Silver is
more sensitive than the Iodide to artificial light, a mixture
of the two salts may conveniently be used (see pp. <a href="#Page_66">66</a> and
<a href="#Page_232">232</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The development may be conducted in the same manner
as that for preserved sensitive plates; fixing with Cyanide
of Potassium before the development is fully complete, if
any tendency to fogging is observed (see <a href="#Page_224">page 224</a>).</p>

<p>The Rev. W. Towler Kingsley has communicated a process
by which very beautiful Microscopic Photographs
have been obtained. He illuminates (in the absence of
sunlight) with the brilliant light produced by throwing
a jet of mixed Oxygen and Hydrogen gases upon a small
cone of Lime or Magnesia. Particular stress is laid upon
the object-glass of the Microscope being a good one for
the purpose; and indeed all who have given attention to
the subject are agreed upon this point&mdash;that there is a
considerable difference in the Photographic value of objectives,
and this independent of the angular aperture of
the glass.</p>

<p>This includes&mdash;the preparation of sensitive paper,&mdash;of
fixing and toning Baths,&mdash;and the manipulatory details of
the process.</p>

<p><i>Selection of Paper for Photographic Printing.</i>&mdash;The
ordinary varieties of paper sold in commerce are not well
adapted for the production of Positive prints. Papers are
manufactured purposely which are more smooth and uniform
in texture. Many samples of even the finest paper
are however defective, and hence each sheet should be examined
separately by holding it against the light, and if
spots or irregularities of texture are seen, it should be rejected.
These spots usually consist of small particles of
brass or iron, which, when the paper is rendered sensitive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
decompose the Nitrate of Silver and leave a circular mark
very noticeable after fixing.</p>

<p>The foreign papers, French and German, are different
from the English. They are porous and sized with starch,
the English being sized with gelatinous animal matter.
In all cases there is a difference in smoothness between the
two sides of the paper, which may be detected by holding
each sheet in such a manner that the light strikes it at an
angle; the wrong side is that on which dark wavy bands,
of an inch to an inch and a half in breadth, are seen, caused
by the strips of felt on which the paper was dried. With
most qualities of paper no difficulty whatever will be experienced
in detecting the broad and regular bands above
referred to; but when they cannot be seen, the wrong side
of the sheet may be known by wire markings crossing each
other, or if the paper be wetted at the corner, one side may
appear evidently smoother than the other.</p>

obtain the Albumen, use new-laid eggs, and be careful
that in opening the shell the yolk is not broken; each egg
will yield about one fluid ounce of Albumen.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> If the water contained much Sulphate of Lime, it is likely that the

<p>When the ingredients are mixed, take a bundle of quills
or a fork, and beat the whole into a perfect froth. As the
froth forms, it is to be skimmed off and placed in a flat
dish to subside. The success of the operation depends
entirely upon the manner in which this part of the process
is conducted;&mdash;if the Albumen be not thoroughly
beaten, flakes of animal membrane will be left in the
liquid, and will cause streaks upon the paper. When the
froth has partially subsided, transfer it to a tall and narrow
jar, and allow to stand for several hours, that the
membranous shreds may settle to the bottom. Then pour
off the upper clear portion, which is fit for use. Albuminous
liquids are too glutinous to run well through a
paper filter, and are better cleared by subsidence.</p>

<p>A more simple plan than the above, and one equally
efficacious, is to fill a bottle to about three parts with the
salted mixture of Albumen and water, and to shake it well
for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour until it loses its
glutinosity and can be poured out smoothly from the neck
of the bottle. It is then to be transferred to an open jar,
and allowed to settle as before.</p>

<p>The solution prepared by the above directions will contain
exactly ten grains of salt to the ounce, dissolved in
an equal bulk of Albumen and water. Some operators
employ the Albumen alone without an addition of water;
but this commonly gives a highly varnished appearance,
which is thought by most to be objectionable. Much however
will depend upon the kind of paper which is employed,
certain varieties taking more gloss than others; Papier
Rive, for instance, often requires the Albumen to be nearly
or quite undiluted.</p>

<p>The principal difficulty in Albuminizing paper, is to
avoid the occurrence of <i>streaky lines</i>, which, when the
paper is rendered sensitive, <i>bronze</i> strongly under the influence
of the light. To avoid them, use the eggs quite fresh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and lower the paper on to the liquid by one steady movement;
if a pause be made, a line will probably be formed.
Some papers are not readily wetted by the Albumen, and
when such is the case, a few drops of spirituous solution of
bile, or a fragment of the prepared Ox-Gall sold by the
artists' colour-men, will be found a useful adjunct. Care
must be taken however not to add an excess, or the Albumen
will be rendered too fluid, and will sink into the
paper, leaving no gloss.</p>

<p>In salting and albuminizing Photographic paper by the
formula above given, it is found that each quarter-sheet,
measuring eleven inches by nine inches, removes one fluid
drachm and a half from the bath, equivalent to about one
grain and three-quarters of salt (including droppings).
In salting plain paper, each quarter-sheet takes up only
one drachm; so that the glutinous nature of the Albumen
causes a third part more of salt to be retained by the
paper.</p>

<p>English papers are not good for albuminizing; they do
not take the Albumen properly, and curl up when laid
upon the liquid: the process of toning the prints is also
slow and tedious. The thin negative paper of Canson, the
Papier Rive, and Papier Saxe, have succeeded with the
writer better than Canson's Positive paper, which is often
recommended; they have a finer texture, and give more
smoothness of grain.</p>

<p>To apply the Albumen, pour a portion of the solution
into a flat dish to the depth of half an inch. Then, having
previously cut the paper to the proper size, take a sheet
by the two corners, bend it into a curved form, convexity
downwards, and lay it upon the Albumen, the centre part
first touching the liquid, and the corners being lowered
gradually. In this way all bubbles of air wall be pushed
forwards and excluded. One side only of the paper is
wetted: the other remains dry. Allow the sheet to rest
upon the solution for <i>one minute and a half</i>, and then
raise it off, and pin it up by two corners. If any circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
spots, free from Albumen, are seen, caused by bubbles
of air, replace the sheet for the same length of time as at
first.</p>

<p>The paper must not be allowed to remain upon the salting
Bath much longer than the time specified, because the
solution of Albumen being <i>alkaline</i> (as is shown by the
strong smell of Ammonia evolved on the addition of the
Chloride of Ammonium) tends to remove the size from the
paper and to sink in too deeply; thus losing its surface
gloss.</p>

<p>Albuminized paper will keep a long time in a dry place.
Some have recommended to press it with a heated iron,
in order to coagulate the layer of Albumen upon the surface;
but this precaution is unnecessary, since the coagulation
is perfectly effected by the Nitrate of Silver used in
the sensitizing; and it is doubtful whether a layer of <i>dry</i>
Albumen would admit of coagulation by the simple application
of a heated iron.</p>

<p>Prepare a sufficient quantity of this solution, and lay the
sheet upon it in the same manner as before. Three minutes'
contact will be sufficient with the thin Negative paper,
but if the Canson Positive paper be used, four or five minutes
must be allowed for the decomposition. The papers
are raised from the solution by a pair of bone forceps or
common tweezers tipped with sealing-wax; or a pin may
be used to lift up the corner, which is then taken by the
finger and thumb and allowed <i>to drain a little</i> before again
putting in the pin, otherwise a white mark will be produced
upon the paper, from decomposition of the Nitrate
of Silver. When the sheet is hung up, a small strip of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
blotting-paper suspended from the lower edge of the paper
will serve to drain off the last drop of liquid.</p>

<p>A Bath prepared by the above formula is stronger than
is really necessary. Forty grains of Nitrate to the ounce
of water is abundantly sufficient if the sample be pure;
but it must be borne in mind that the <i>strength</i> of the Bath
diminishes <i>rapidly</i> by use, and hence, when the prints begin
to be wanting in vigour, with pale shadows and perhaps
a spotted appearance, an addition of Nitrate of Silver must
be made. Fused Nitrate of Silver is recommended in preference
to the crystallized Nitrate, on account of the latter
being occasionally contaminated with an impurity alluded
to at <a href="#Page_101">page 101</a>. This when present will be likely to redden
the pictures and to interfere with the rapidity of bronzing.</p>

<p>The solution of Nitrate of Silver becomes after a time
discoloured by the Albumen, but may be used for sensitizing
until it is nearly black. The colour can be removed
by Animal Charcoal,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but a better plan is to use
the "kaolin," or pure white china clay. This substance
often contains Carbonate of Lime, and effervesces with
acids: it must in such a case be purified by washing in
vinegar, or the Bath will become alkaline, and dissolve off
the Albumen. It has been stated that an addition of Alcohol
to the Nitrate Bath prevents it discolouring with
Albumen.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Common Animal Charcoal contains Carbonate and Phosphate of
Lime, the former of which renders the Nitrate of Silver alkaline; purified

<p>Sensitive albuminized paper will usually keep for several
days, if protected from the light, but afterwards turns
yellow from partial decomposition.</p>

<p>Dissolve the Gelatine by the aid of heat; add the other
ingredients, and filter. The solution cannot be kept longer
than two or three weeks without becoming mouldy. The
Saxony paper, or Towgood's English paper, may be employed;
the Gelatine and Citrate being retained or omitted,
according to the taste of the operator and the mode
of toning which is adopted.</p>

<p>Render sensitive by a solution of Ammonio-Nitrate of
Silver, 60 grains to the ounce of water, which is prepared
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dissolve the Nitrate of Silver in one-half of the total
quantity of water. Then take a pure solution of Ammonia
and drop it in carefully, stirring meanwhile with a
glass rod. A brown precipitate of Oxide of Silver first
forms, but on the addition of more Ammonia it is re-dissolved.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
When the liquid appears to be clearing up,
add the Ammonia very cautiously, so as not to incur an
excess. In order still further to secure the absence of
free Ammonia, it is usual to direct, that when the liquid
becomes perfectly clear, a drop or two of solution of Nitrate
of Silver should be added until a <i>slight turbidity</i> is
again produced. Lastly, dilute with water to the proper
bulk. If the crystals of Nitrate of Silver employed contain
a large excess of free Nitric Acid, no precipitate will
be formed on the first addition of Ammonia. The free
Nitric Acid, producing <i>Nitrate of Ammonia</i> with the alkali,
keeps the Oxide of Silver in solution. This cause of
error however is not likely to happen frequently, since the
amount of Nitrate of Ammonia required to prevent all precipitation
would be considerable. From the same reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
viz. the presence of Nitrate of Ammonia, it is often useless
to attempt to convert an old Nitrate Bath already used
for sensitizing, into Ammonio-Nitrate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> If the excess of Ammonia does not readily dissolve it,
probably the Nitrate of Silver is impure.</p></div>

<p>Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver should be kept in a dark
place, being more prone to reduction than the Nitrate of
Silver.</p>

<p>Sensitizing paper with Ammonio-Nitrate.&mdash;It is not
usual to float the paper when, the Ammonio-Nitrate of
Silver is used. If a bath of this liquid were employed, it
would not only become quickly discoloured by the action
of organic matter dissolved out of the papers, but would
soon contain abundance of free Ammonia (see the Vocabulary,
Part III., art. "Ammonio-Nitrate"); and an excess
of Ammonia in the liquid produces an injurious effect by
dissolving away the sensitive Chloride of Silver.</p>

<p>The Ammonio-Nitrate is therefore applied with a glass
rod, or by brushing, and in neither case is any of the
liquid which has once touched the paper allowed to return
into the bottle.</p>

<p>Brushes are manufactured purposely for applying Silver
solutions, but the hair is soon destroyed unless the brush
be kept scrupulously clean. Lay the salted sheet upon
blotting-paper, and wet it thoroughly by drawing the brush
first lengthways and then across. Allow it to remain flat
for a minute or so, in order that a sufficient quantity of the
solution may be absorbed (you will see when it is evenly
wet by looking along the surface), and then pin up by the
corner in the usual way. If, on drying, white lines appear
at the points last touched by the brush, it is probable that
the Ammonio-Nitrate contains free Ammonia.</p>

<p>The employment of a glass rod is a very simple and economical
mode of applying Silver solutions. Procure a flat
piece of board somewhat smaller than the sheet to be operated
on, and having turned over the edges of the paper,
secure them with a pin. Next bring the board near to the
corner of the table, and laying the glass rod along the edge
of the paper, allow the fluid to drop into the groove so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
formed; then carry the rod directly across the sheet, when
an even wave of fluid will be spread over the surface. A
pipette made of glass tubing, when dipped into the bottle
and the upper end closed with the finger, will withdraw
as much of the Ammonio-Nitrate as is required; and if a
scratch be made upon the tube at a point corresponding to
30 or 40 minims, it will be found sufficient for a quarter
sheet of the Papier Saxe.</p>

<p>Ammonio-Nitrate paper, however prepared, cannot be
kept many hours without becoming brown and discoloured.</p>

<p><i>Use of a solution of Oxide of Silver in Nitrate of Ammonia.</i>&mdash;The
great objection to the use of Ammonio-Nitrate
of Silver is the <i>decomposition</i> which it sometimes
experiences by keeping, metallic Silver separating and
Ammonia being set free. To obviate this liberation of
Ammonia, the Author employs Nitrate of Ammonia as the
solvent for the Oxide of Silver. The solution is prepared
as follows:&mdash;Dissolve 60 grains of <i>Nitrate of Silver</i> in half
an ounce of water, and drop in Ammonia until the precipitated
Oxide of Silver is exactly re-dissolved. Then divide
this solution of Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver into two equal
parts, to one of which add Nitric Acid cautiously, until a
piece of immersed litmus-paper is reddened by an excess
of the acid; then mix the two together, fill up to one ounce
with water, and filter from the milky deposit of Chloride
or Carbonate of Silver, if any be formed.</p>

<p>This solution of Oxide of Silver in Nitrate of Ammonia
appears to possess all the advantages of the Ammonio-Nitrate
without the inconvenience of liberating so much
free Ammonia upon the surface of the sensitive sheets.</p>

<p><i>Hints in selecting from the above Formulæ.</i>&mdash;Albuminized
paper is the most simple and generally useful; it is
well fitted for small portraits and stereoscopic Photographs.
The Ammonio-Nitrate Process requires more experience,
but gives excellent results when black tones are
required: it may be used for larger portraits, engravings, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Plain paper rendered sensitive by floating upon a Bath
of Nitrate of Silver is easier of manipulation than the Ammonio-Nitrate,
and will be found to be better adapted for
toning by the Sel d'or Bath (<a href="#Page_267">p. 267</a>) than the Albuminized
Paper.</p>

<p>Dissolve the Hyposulphite of Soda in four ounces of the
water, the Chloride of Gold in three ounces, the Nitrate
of Silver in the remaining ounce; then pour the diluted
Chloride by degrees into the Hyposulphite, stirring with
a glass rod; and afterwards the Nitrate of Silver in the
same way. This order of mixing the solutions is to be
strictly observed: if it were reversed, the Hyposulphite
of Soda being added to the Chloride of Gold, the result
would be the reduction of Metallic Gold; Hyposulphite of
Gold, which is formed, being an unstable substance, and
not capable of existing in contact with unaltered Chloride
of Gold. If however it be dissolved by Hyposulphite of
Soda immediately on its formation, it is rendered more
permanent, by conversion into a double salt of Soda and
Gold.</p>

<p>In place of Nitrate of Silver, recommended in the formula,
Chloride of Silver may be used, but not Iodide of
Silver, as the formation of Iodide of Sodium would be objectionable
(<a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>). For the same reason it is better not
to add any part of the Hyposulphite Bath used for fixing
Negatives, to the Positive colouring solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>This toning Bath is not to be employed immediately
after mixing, but should be set aside until a portion of
Sulphur (produced by free Hydrochloric Acid, and Tetrathionate
of Soda reacting upon the Hyposulphite) has
subsided. It will be very active at the expiration of a few
days or a week; but upon keeping for a longer time, loses
much of its efficacy by a process of spontaneous change.</p>

<p>The immersion of prints also lessens the quantity of
Gold; and hence, when the Bath begins to work slowly,
more of the Chloride must be added, the Sulphur being
allowed to deposit as before. Filtration through blotting-paper
will not be required.</p>

<p>The writer finds that after a certain time, when the
Bath has been long used, and organic matters, Albumen,
etc., have accumulated in it, it is better, and more economical,
to throw away what remains, and to prepare a
new solution. The addition of Chloride of Gold to an
old Bath will not always make it work as quickly as one
recently mixed.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE MANIPULATORY DETAILS OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTING.</p>

<p>These include&mdash;the exposure to light, or printing properly
so called; the fixing and toning; and the washing,
drying, and mounting of the proof.</p>

<p>The Exposure to Light.&mdash;For this purpose reversing
frames are sold, which admit of being opened at the back,
in order to examine the progress of the darkening by light,
without producing any disturbance of position.</p>

<p>Simple squares of glass however succeed equally well,
when a little experience has been acquired. They may be
held together by the wooden clips sold at the American
warehouses at one shilling per dozen. The lower plate
should be covered with black cloth or velvet.</p>

<p>Supposing the frame to be employed, the shutter at the
back is removed, and the Negative laid flat upon the glass,
Collodion side uppermost. A sheet of sensitive paper is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
then placed upon the Negative, sensitive side downwards,
and the whole tightly compressed by replacing and bolting
down the shutter.</p>

<p>This operation may be conducted in the dark room; but
unless the light be strong, such a precaution will not be
required. The time of exposure to light varies much with
the density of the Negative and the power of the actinic
rays, as influenced by the season of the year and other obvious
considerations. As a general rule, the best Negatives
print slowly; whereas Negatives which have been
under-exposed and under-developed print more quickly.</p>

<p>In the early spring or summer, when the light is powerful,
probably about ten to fifteen minutes will be required;
but from three-quarters of an hour to an hour and a half
may be allowed in the winter months, even in the direct
rays of the sun.</p>

<p>It is always easy to judge of the length of time which
will be sufficient, by exposing a small slip of the sensitive
paper, unshielded, to the sun's rays, and observing how long
it takes to reach the coppery stage of reduction. Whatever
that time may be, nearly the same will be occupied in the
printing, if the Negative be a good one.</p>

<p>When the darkening of the paper appears to have proceeded
to a considerable extent, the frame is to be taken
in and the picture examined. If squares of plate glass are
used to keep the Negative and sensitive paper in contact,
some difficulty may be experienced at first in returning
it precisely to its former position after the examination
is complete, but this will easily be overcome by practice.
The finger and thumb should be fixed on the lower corners
or edge, and the plate raised evenly and quickly.</p>

<p>If the exposure to light has been sufficiently long, the
print appears slightly darker than it is intended to remain.
The toning Bath dissolves away the lighter shades, and reduces
the intensity, for which allowance is made in the
exposure to light. A little experience soon teaches what
is the proper point; but much will depend upon the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of the toning Bath; and albuminized paper will require to
be printed somewhat more deeply than plain paper.</p>

<p>If, on removal from the printing-frame, a peculiar <i>spotted</i>
appearance is seen, produced by unequal darkening
of the Chloride of Silver, either the Nitrate Bath is too
weak, the sheet removed from its surface too speedily, or
the paper is of inferior quality.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the general aspect of the print is
a rich chocolate-brown in the case of Albumen, a dark
slate-blue with Ammonio-Nitrate Paper, or a reddish purple
with paper prepared with Chloride and Citrate of
Silver, probably the subsequent parts of the process will
proceed well.</p>

<p>If, in the exposure to light, the shadows of the proof
become very decidedly <i>coppery</i> before the lights are sufficiently
printed, the Negative is in fault. Ammonio-Nitrate
paper highly salted is particularly liable to this fault of excess
of reduction, and especially so if the light be powerful;
hence it is best, in the summer months, not to print
by the direct rays of the Sun. This point is important
also, because the excessive heat of the Sun's rays often
cracks the glasses by unequal expansion, and glues the
Negative firmly down to the sensitive paper. An exception
however may be made in the case of Negatives of
great intensity; which are printed most successfully upon,
a weakly sensitized paper (<a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>) exposed to the full rays
of the Sun; a feeble light not fully penetrating the dark
parts.</p>

<p><i>The fixing and toning of the proof.</i>&mdash;No injury results
from postponing this part of the process for many hours,
provided the print be kept in a dark place.</p>

<p>The mode often followed is to immerse the Positive in
the Hyposulphite Bath in the state in which it comes from
the printing-frame; moving it about in the liquid in order
to displace air-bubbles, which, if allowed to remain, produce
spots. But the Author, for reasons given in the first
part of the Work (pp. <a href="#Page_129">129</a> and <a href="#Page_165">165</a>), recommends that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
print should first be washed in common water until the
soluble Nitrate of Silver has been removed.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This is known
to be the case when the liquid flows away clear; the first
milkiness being caused by the soluble Carbonates and
Chlorides in the water precipitating the Nitrate of Silver.
Greater security is thus afforded that the print will be toned
in a really permanent manner, since after removing the
Nitrate of Silver from the proof, the Bath does not work
quickly unless the supply of Gold be well maintained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> This water must be free from Hyposulphite of Soda, or the print will
become discoloured.</p></div>

<p>Immediately on coming in contact with the Hyposulphite
of Soda in the fixing and toning Bath, the chocolate
brown or violet tint of the Positive disappears, and leaves
the image of a red tone. Albumen proofs become brick-red;
Ammonio-Nitrate a sepia or brown-black. If the
colour is unusually <i>pale</i> at this stage, probably the Silver
Bath is too weak, or the quantity of Chloride of Ammonium
or Sodium insufficient.</p>

<p>After the print has been thoroughly reddened, the <i>toning</i>
action begins, and must be continued until the desired effect
is obtained. This may happen in from ten minutes to a
quarter of an hour, if the solution is in good working order
and the thermometer at 60°; but much depends upon the
temperature, and the activity of the Bath. English papers,
and especially the same prepared with Albumen, tone more
slowly than foreign papers plain salted.</p>

<p>The brown and purple tints are an earlier stage of coloration
than the black tones, and therefore the latter require
more time. It must be borne in mind however that prolonged
immersion in the Bath is favourable to sulphuration
and yellowness; tending also to render the image unstable
and liable to fade in the half-tones. This fading may not
be seen decidedly whilst the print is in the Bath, but will
show itself in the after-processes of washing and drying.</p>

<p>The ultimate colour of the Print will vary much with
the density of the Negative and the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
subject; copies of line engravings, having but little half-tone,
are easily obtained of a dark shade resembling the original
impression.</p>

<p>Some advise that on removal from the toning Bath the
Print should be soaked in new Hyposulphite for ten minutes,
to complete the fixation; but this precaution is not
required with a Bath of the strength given in the formula.
An analysis of an old Bath which had been extensively
used, indicated only ten grains of Hyposulphite of Silver
to the ounce, so that it was far from saturated.</p>

<p>The occasional addition of fresh crystals of Hyposulphite
of Soda to keep up the strength of the Bath, is useful,
the exact quantity added not being material.</p>

<p><i>The washing, drying, and mounting of the Positive Proofs.</i>&mdash;It
is essential to wash out every trace of Hyposulphite
of Soda from the Print if it is to be preserved from fading,
and to do this properly requires considerable care.</p>

<p>Always wash with running water when it can be obtained,
and choose a large shallow vessel exposing a considerable
surface in preference to one of lesser diameter.
A constant dribbling of water must be maintained for four
or five hours, and the prints should not lie together too
closely, or the water does not find its way between them,
(see the remarks at <a href="#Page_162">p. 162</a>).</p>

<p>When running water cannot be obtained, proceed as
follows:&mdash;first wash the Prints gently, to remove the
greater part of the Hyposulphite solution. Then transfer
them to a large shallow pan, in which may be placed as
many Prints as it will conveniently hold. Leave them
in for about a quarter of an hour, with occasional movement,
and then pour off the water quite dry. This point
is important, viz. to drain off the last portion of liquid
completely before adding fresh water. Repeat the process
of changing at least five or six times, or more, according
to the bulk of water, number of Prints, and degree of attention
paid to them.</p>

<p>Lastly, proceed to remove the size from the Print by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
immersion in boiling water.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This process will give some
idea of the permanency of the tints, since, if they become
dull and red, <i>and do not darken on drying</i>, the Print is
probably toned without Gold. Ammonio-Nitrate and plain
paper Prints prepared on foreign papers by the modes described
in this Work, may be expected to stand the test of
boiling water; Albumen Prints and Positives on English
paper are a little reddened, although not to an objectionable
degree.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> The Print must be well washed in cold water, to remove the
Hyposulphite, before using the hot water; or the half-tones will be liable
to be darkened, or changed to incipient yellowness, by sulphuration. This point is
important as regards the permanency.</p></div>

<p>The size may also be effectually removed from the Print
by the common Carbonate of Soda used in washing, although
the former process is recommended as the most secure.
Dissolve about a handful of the Soda in a pint of
water, and when the milky deposit, if any occurs, has subsided,
immerse the washed Positives for twenty minutes
or half an hour. The Soda renders the paper quite porous,
but produces no alteration of tint. If the process be properly
performed, ink will <i>run</i> in attempting to write upon
the back of the finished picture. After removal from the
Soda Bath a second washing will be required, but the time
of the first washing may be proportionally shortened.
Here a difficulty will occur with many kinds of water; the
Carbonate of Soda precipitating <i>Carbonate of Lime</i>, in
the form of a white powder which obscures the picture.
To obviate this, use <i>rain water</i> until the greater part of
the alkaline salt has been removed, and do not allow a
stationary layer of liquid to rest too long upon the Print.
The New River water supplied to many parts of London,
being comparatively soft, answers perfectly, and produces
no white deposit, if the proofs are moved about occasionally.</p>

<p>When the Prints have been thoroughly washed, blot
them off between sheets of porous paper and hang up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
dry. Some press them with a hot iron, which darkens the
colour slightly, but does so in an injurious manner when
Hyposulphite of Soda is left in the paper.</p>

<p>Albumen proofs when dry are sufficiently bright without
further treatment; but in the case of plain paper, salted
simply, the effect is improved by laying the Print face
downwards upon a square of plate-glass and rubbing the
back with an agate burnisher, sold at the artists' colour-men's.
This hardens the grain of the paper and brings
out the details of the picture. Hot-pressing has a similar
effect and is often employed.</p>

<p>Mount the proofs with a solution of Gelatine in hot
water, freshly made; the best Scotch glue answers well.
Gum water, prepared from the finest commercial gum,
and free from acidity, may also be used, but it should be
made very thick, that it may not sink into the paper, nor
produce an unpleasant "cockling up" of the cardboard,
which is caused by the damp and expanded print contracting
as it dries.</p>

<p>Caoutchouc dissolved in mineral Naphtha to the consistence
of thick glue or gold-beaters' size, is employed by
many for mounting Photographic Prints; it may be obtained
at the varnish shops, and is sold in tin boxes. The
mode of using it is as follows:&mdash;with a broad brush made
of stiff bristles, apply the cement to the back of the picture;
then take a strip of glass with a straight edge, and
by drawing it across the paper, scrape off as much as
possible of the excess. The print will then be found to
adhere very readily to the cardboard, without causing expansion
or cockling; and any portion of the cement which
oozes out during the pressing may, when dry, be removed
with a penknife without leaving a stain.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">REMARKS UPON THE WANT OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN
THE FORMULA OF DIFFERENT OPERATORS.</p>

<p>The formulæ for Positive printing given in the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
on practical Photography exhibit great variety; and it
has been proposed to attempt to reduce them to more
uniform proportions. This cannot however easily be done,
both on account of the difference in the structure and preparation
of the various Photographic papers, and also because
the mode of applying the solutions is not always
the same.</p>

<p>Take as an illustration the following process, which has
long been recommended for its simplicity, and which is in
every respect a good one:&mdash;Dissolve 40 grains of Chloride
of Ammonium in 20 ounces of Distilled Water, and <i>immerse</i>
about a dozen sheets of Towgood's Positive paper,
removing air-bubbles with a camels'-hair brush. When the
last sheet has been placed in the liquid, turn the batch
over and take them out one by one, so that each sheet,
remaining in the liquid at least ten minutes, may be
thoroughly saturated. When dry, excite by brushing with
a 40 or 60-grain solution of Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver in
the usual way.</p>

<p>Now this formula contains less than one-fifth of the
amount of salt often employed, and if a thick foreign paper
sized with starch, such as Canson's Positive, were <i>floated</i>
upon such a salting Bath, it would be difficult to obtain a
good picture. By <i>immersing</i> however a paper sized with
Gelatine like the one recommended, a much larger quantity
of salt is retained upon the surface, and the film is
sufficiently sensitive. There are three modes of applying
solutions, viz. by brushing, floating, and immersion. The
quantity of solution left on the paper varies with each, and
consequently each requires a different formula. Immersion
in a strong salting Bath tends to give a coarse picture
wanting in definition; whereas the plan of brushing a
weak salting solution, produces a paper deficient in sensitiveness,
and yielding a pale red image without proper
depth of shadow.</p>

<p>But independent of these differences, the chemical nature
of the <i>size</i> employed also influences the toning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Print. For instance, in the process above given, if the
Positives, after having been fully toned in the Gold Bath,
and washed in cold water, be treated with <i>boiling water</i>,
the tint immediately changes to a dull red; but on blotting
off between sheets of bibulous paper and pressing
with a hot iron, the dark tones are restored.</p>

<p>This destruction of the tint by boiling water, and its
restoration by <i>dry heat</i>, is due in great part to the animal
substance employed in sizing the paper; and it will be
found that prints upon a foreign paper, such as the Saxony
Positive, salted with a ten-grain solution and sensitized
with Ammonio-Nitrate, do not lose their tones in hot
water and are not much darkened by ironing.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the sizing of the English Photographic
papers must therefore be borne in mind, and allowance
made for the additional sensitiveness and alteration
of colour which it produces. When a formula is given,
the paper which is recommended for that particular formula
should alone be used.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Positive Printing by Development.</i></p>

<p>Negative printing processes will be found useful during
the dull winter months, and at other times when the light
is feeble, or when it is required to produce a large number
of impressions from a Negative in a short space of time.
The plan of development also enables the operator to obtain
Positives of greater stability than those yielded by
the direct action of light.</p>

<p>Three processes may be described, the first of which
gives Positives of an agreeable colour, but the second, on
Iodide of Silver, the greatest permanency under unfavourable
conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4nb">NEGATIVE PRINTING PROCESSES UPON CHLORIDE OF SILVER.</p>

<p>Positives may be obtained by exposing paper prepared
with Chloride of Silver to the action of light until a faint
image is perceptible, and subsequently developing by
Gallic Acid; but in this process it is difficult to obtain
sufficient <i>contrast</i> of light and shade; the impression, if
sufficiently exposed and not too much developed, being
feeble, with a want of intensity in the dark parts. By associating
with the Chloride an organic salt of Silver, such
as the Citrate, this difficulty may be overcome, and the
shadows be brought out with great depth and distinctness.</p>

<p>The papers are salted with a mixed Chloride and Citrate
as in the formula for the Ammonio-Nitrate Process.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
They are then rendered sensitive upon a Bath of Nitrate
of Silver <i>containing</i> either Citric or <i>Acetic Acid</i>, which
are used in Negative processes to preserve the clearness
of the white parts under the influence of the developer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> The formula at <a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a> may be modified with advantage: use double the
quantity of Gelatine, and half the amount of Citrate and Chloride.</p></div>

<p>The Bath of Aceto-Nitrate is prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Float the papers (Papier Saxe or Papier Rive) upon the
Bath for three minutes, and suspend them to dry in a room
from which actinic rays are <i>perfectly</i> excluded.</p>

<p>The exposure to light,&mdash;which is conducted in the ordinary
printing frame, the Negative and sensitive paper being
laid in contact in the usual way,&mdash;will seldom be longer than
three or four minutes, even upon a dull day. It may be
regulated by the colour assumed by the projecting margin
of the paper; but it is quite possible to tell by the appearance
of the image when it has received a sufficient amount
of exposure:&mdash;the whole of the picture should be seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
excepting the <i>lightest shades</i>, and it will be found that
very few details can be brought out in the development
which were altogether invisible before the Gallic Acid was
applied.</p>

<p>The developing solution is prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Gallic Acid</td>
  <td class="tdr">2</td>
  <td class="tdl">grains.</td>

<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Water</td>
  <td class="tdr">1</td>
  <td class="tdl">fluid ounce.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In very cold weather it may be necessary to employ a
saturated solution of Gallic Acid, containing about four
grains to the ounce; whereas in warm weather the image
will develope too quickly, and Acetic Acid must be added
(see the remarks at the end of the process, <a href="#Page_266">p. 266</a>).</p>

<p>To facilitate the solution of the Gallic Acid, stand the
bottle in a warm place near the fire. A lump of Camphor
floated in the liquid, or a drop of Oil of Cloves added, will
to a great extent prevent it from becoming mouldy by
keeping; but if once mould has formed, the bottle must be
well cleansed with Nitric Acid, or the decomposition of the
fresh Gallic Acid will be hastened.</p>

<p>Pour the solution of Gallic Acid into a flat dish, and immerse
the Prints two or three at a time, moving them
about, and using a glass rod to remove air-bubbles. The
development is rapid, and will be completed in three
or four minutes. If the Print developes slowly, becomes
<i>very dark in colour</i> by continuing the action of the Gallic
Acid, but shows no half-tones, it has not been exposed
sufficiently long to the light. An over-exposed proof, on
the other hand, developes with unusual rapidity, and it is
necessary to remove it speedily from the Bath in order to
preserve the clearness of the white parts; when taken out
to the light, it appears pale and red, with no depth of shadow.</p>

<p>The extent to which the development should be carried
depends upon the kind of Print desired. By pushing the
action of the Gallic Acid, a dark picture not much altered
by the fixing Bath will be produced. But a better result
as regards colour and gradation of tone will be obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
by removing the Print from the developing solution whilst
in the light red stage, and toning it subsequently by means
of Gold; in which case it will correspond both in appearance
and properties to a Positive obtained by the direct
action of light (see the remarks at <a href="#Page_167">page 167</a>).</p>

<p>When it is intended to follow the latter plan, the action
of the developer must be stopped at a point when the proof
appears lighter than it is to remain; since the Sel d'or
Bath adds a little to the intensity, and the image becomes
somewhat more vigorous on drying.</p>

<p>Wash the Prints in cold water in order to extract all
the Gallic Acid. Then tone with <i>Sel d'or</i> in the manner
described in the next Section, and fix in the usual way.
The whites will with care be kept pure; or with only a
faint yellow tinge, which is not objectionable.</p>

<p>Upon comparing the developed Prints with others obtained
by the direct action of light upon the same sensitive
paper, it is evident that the advantage is <i>slightly</i> on
the side of the latter; but the difference is so small that it
would be overlooked in printing large subjects, for which
the Negative Process is more especially adapted. The <i>colour</i>
of both kinds of Positives is the same, or perhaps a
shade darker in the developed proofs, which are usually of
a violet-purple tone, but sometimes of a dark chocolate-brown.</p>

<p><i>A developing process with Serum of Milk.</i>&mdash;The use of
"whey" as a vehicle for Chloride of Silver has something
the same effect as that produced by adding a Citrate. This
may be traced to the presence of the Milk Sugar and of a
portion of uncoagulated Caseine left in the Serum.</p>

<p>The only difficulty in the process is to coagulate the
milk in such a way as to separate the greater part but not
the whole of the Caseine. Milk which has become sour,
or to which an acid has been added, is not considered so
good for the purpose as that which has been treated with
rennet; and even when rennet is used it must be of the
best quality or its action will be imperfect. The serum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
must filter clear through, blotting-paper; but it should not
run very rapidly, or in all probability the whole of the
Caseine has been separated, and the fluid contains little besides
sugar. The whey which is left after cheese-making,
commonly answers the purpose, if clarified by beating it
up with the white of an egg and subsequently boiling and
filtering. Globules of oil must be separated as far as
possible, or they will produce a greasiness of the paper.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Salt the prepared Serum with Chloride of Sodium or

<p class="caption4nb">A NEGATIVE PRINTING PROCESS UPON IODIDE OF SILVER.</p>

<p>Iodide of Silver is more sensitive to the reception of the
invisible image than the other compounds of that metal;
and hence it is usefully employed in printing <i>enlarged</i> Positives
from small Negatives, by means of the Camera.
The great stability of the proofs upon Iodide of Silver will
also be a recommendation of this process when unusual

<p>The best paper to use will be either Turner's Calotype,

<p>When the sheet is quite dry, place it in contact with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Negative in a pressure frame, and expose <i>to a feeble light</i>.
About 30 seconds will be an average time upon a dull winter's
day, on which it would be impossible to print at all
in the ordinary way. On removing the Negative nothing
whatever is seen upon the paper, the image being strictly
invisible in this process unless the exposure has been carried
too far.</p>

<p>Develope by immersion in a saturated solution of Gallic
Acid, prepared in the manner described at <a href="#Page_261">page 261</a>. The
image appears slowly, and the process may last from 15
minutes to half an hour. If the exposure has been correctly
timed, the Gallic Acid appears at length almost to
cease acting; but when the proof has been over-exposed,
the development goes on uninterruptedly, and the image
becomes too dark, partaking more of the character of a
Negative than a Positive. The usual rule, that <i>under</i>-exposed
proofs develope slowly but show no half-tones, and
that the <i>over</i>-exposed develope with unusual rapidity, is
also observed in the process with Iodide of Silver.</p>

<p>After the picture is fully brought out, wash in cold, and
subsequently in warm water, to remove the Gallic Acid,
which, if allowed to remain, would discolour the Hyposulphite
Bath. Then fix the Print in a solution of Hyposulphite
of Soda, one part to two of water, continuing the
action until the yellow colour of the Iodide disappears.
The fixing Bath ought not to produce much change in the
tint. If the Positive loses its dark colour on immersion
in the Hyposulphite, and becomes pale and red, it has
been insufficiently developed. The theory of this part of
the process should be understood:&mdash;It is particularly the
<i>second stage</i> of the development of a Photograph (see p.
144) on which the fixing Bath produces no effect; and
therefore a considerable change of colour in the Hyposulphite
indicates that too little Silver has been deposited,
and the remedy will be to push the development, adding
a little Aceto-Nitrate to the Gallic Acid if the strength of
the Bath be found insufficient to yield dark tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The colour of Positives developed upon Iodide of Silver
is not agreeable, and they become blue and inky when
toned with gold. By fixing the proof in Hyposulphite of
Soda which has been long used and has acquired sulphuretting
properties, the tint is much improved; but the
permanency of the Print under unfavourable conditions is
lessened by adopting that mode of toning.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">A NEGATIVE PRINTING PROCESS UPON BROMIDE OF SILVER.</p>

<p>By substituting the Bromide for the Iodide of Silver in
the above process, the proportions and details of manipulation
being in other respects the same, a more agreeable
colour is obtained.</p>

<p>Paper prepared with Bromide of Silver is less sensitive
than the Iodide, but an exposure of one minute (in the
printing frame) will usually be sufficient even on a dull
day. The image is nearly latent, but sometimes a very
faint outline of the darkest shadows can be seen. The proportion
of Bromide used is likely to influence this point;
the sensitiveness being diminished, but the image showing
more of the details before development, when the quantity
of the Silver Salt is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Either English or French papers may be used, but in
the latter case the Bromide should be dissolved in Serum
of Milk (<a href="#Page_262">p. 262</a>), or it will be difficult to obtain a good surface
picture. The proportion of Bromide may be five grains
to the ounce of Serum.</p>

<p>These proofs, even when simply fixed in plain Hyposulphite
of Soda, are superior in colour to the Positives printed
by the last formula upon Iodide of Silver; and the permanency
is very great if the development be sufficiently
pushed. The use of the Serum of Milk gives an advantage
in resisting the oxidizing influences to which Positives
are liable to be exposed (<a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>).</p>


<p class="caption4nb">GENERAL REMARKS ON NEGATIVE PRINTING.</p>

<p>Printing by development should not be attempted until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the manipulation of the ordinary process by direct exposure
to light has been acquired.</p>

<p>Perfect cleanliness is essential. The salting or iodizing
solution and the Aceto-Nitrate Bath must be filtered clear,
as the effect of small suspended particles in producing
spots is more seen when the image is brought out by a
developer.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to be far more careful in excluding
white light than in the ordinary process; and when Iodide
of Silver is used, all the precautions required in the
case of Collodion Negatives must be taken.</p>

<p>Observe particularly that the dishes are kept clean,
or the Gallo-Nitrate of Silver will be rapidly discoloured
(read the remarks at <a href="#Page_179">page 179</a>).</p>

<p>Stereoscopic Negatives and small portraits are not successfully
printed by development; since it is difficult to
obtain the most elaborate definition, and there is a slight
tendency to yellowness in the white parts. Positives may
be developed upon Albumen paper, but the Gallic Acid is
apt to discolour the lights.</p>

<p>In printing by development upon Chloride of Silver, the
theory of the subject must be particularly studied. When
the weather is cold and the light bad, the development of
the image proceeds slowly, the Gallic Acid Bath remains
clear, and good half-tones are obtained; but under opposite
conditions, the developer may become turbid and the
shadows be lost by excessive deposit of Silver. This <i>over-development</i>
will be remedied by printing the Negative in
a more feeble light (near to the open window of a room),
and by adding Acetic Acid to the developer, about 5 or 10
minims to the ounce, so as to bring out the image more
slowly. The intensity of action is thus lessened, and if
the picture be not under-exposed, the half-tones will be
good.</p>

<p>Observe also when preparing papers with Citrate, that
if too much Carbonate of Soda be added in neutralizing
the Citric Acid, Carbonate of Silver will be deposited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the paper, the effect of which is to remove by degrees the
acidity of the Nitrate Bath, and to produce over-development
and excessive sensibility to light.</p>

<p>The colour of the proofs when taken from the Gallic
Acid should be <i>light red</i>; the gradation of tone not being
usually so perfect when the development is carried into
the second or black stage.</p>

<p>It is not recommended to prepare too large a stock of
the salted papers, as they will probably be liable to
mouldiness and decomposition unless kept perfectly dry.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Sel d'or Process for toning Positives.</i></p>

<p>This process is somewhat more troublesome than the
plan of fixing and toning in one solution, but possesses advantages
which will presently be enumerated. The description
may be divided into the preparation of the toning
Bath, and the manipulatory details.</p>

<p>Dissolve the Gold and Hyposulphite of Soda each in two
ounces of the water; then mix quickly by pouring the
former solution into the latter, and add the Hydrochloric
Acid. If the Chloride of Gold be neutral, the liquid will
have a red tinge, but if <i>acid</i>, then the solution may be
colourless. The commercial Chloride of Gold, containing
usually much free Hydrochloric Acid, will not require
any addition of that substance. (See the Vocabulary,
Part III.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>In place of making an extemporaneous Hyposulphite of
Gold by mixing the Chloride with Hyposulphite of Soda,
the Crystallized Sel d'or may be used, adding about half
a grain to the ounce of water, acidified as before; but the
objection to the employment of this salt is its expense,
and also the difficulty of obtaining it in a pure form; some
samples containing less than five per cent, of Gold.</p>

<p>It will be found very convenient to keep the two solutions
on hand ready for mixing, viz. the Chloride of Gold
dissolved in water in the proportion of a grain to the
drachm, and the Hyposulphite of Soda, three grains to
the drachm. When required for use, measure out a fluid
drachm of each, dilute with water to two ounces, and mix.</p>

<p>It is possible that the three-grain solution of Hyposulphite
of Soda may by long keeping become decomposed,
with precipitation of Sulphur. The effect of this would
be to produce a turbidity and deposit of Gold on mixing
the ingredients for the Bath, the Chloride of Gold being
in excess over the Hyposulphite of Soda (see <a href="#Page_250">p. 250</a>).</p>

<p>The Bath of Sel d'or is always most active when recently
mixed, but it will keep good for some days if contact with
free Nitrate of Silver be avoided. The addition of this
substance produces a red deposit in the Bath, containing
Gold, and the solution then becomes useless.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">DETAILS OF MANIPULATION.</p>

<p>The paper may be prepared by either of the formulæ
given in the first Section of this Chapter, according to the
tint desired. The pure black tones are obtained most
easily with the Ammonio-Nitrate paper, and the purple
tints, without gloss, on paper prepared with plain Chloride
and Citrate of Soda.</p>

<p>The printing is not carried quite to the usual intensity,
as the half-tones are very little dissolved in this process.</p>

<p>On being taken from the frame, the prints are washed
thoroughly in common water until it ceases to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
milky; that is, until the greater part of the Nitrate of
Silver has been removed. The washing must be conducted
in a dark place, but it is not necessary to hasten it; the
proofs may be thrown into a pan of water covered with a
cloth, and allowed to remain until required for tinting.</p>

<p>A trace of free Nitrate of Silver usually escapes the
washing; this would cause a yellow deposit on the Print,
and also in the toning Bath. It must therefore be removed,
either by adding a little <i>common salt</i> to the water
during the last washings, or by means of a dilute solution
of Ammonia.</p>

<p>For plain paper Prints the former plan will be found
the least troublesome; but with Albumen proofs<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the
Ammonia is required, in order to dissolve away a portion
of the Albuminate of Silver which has escaped the action
of light, before submitting the print to the gold; otherwise
the dark tones would nearly disappear in the fixing
Bath, the Hyposulphite carrying away the Gold with this
superficial layer of silver salt.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The amateur is recommended not to use Albuminized paper in this
process until he has become accustomed to the manipulations; the plain
paper prints being toned with more ease and certainty.</p></div>

<p>To prepare the Ammonia Bath, take of</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Liquor Ammoniæ</td>
  <td class="tdr">1</td>
  <td class="tdl">drachm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Common Water</td>
  <td class="tdr">1</td>
  <td class="tdl">pint.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The exact quantity is not material; if the liquid smells
faintly of Ammonia, it will be sufficient. Place the washed
Prints in this Bath, two or three at a time, and allow
them to remain until the purple tint gives place to a red
tone. The action must be watched, because if the Ammonia
Bath be strong, the proof becomes unusually <i>pale
and red</i>, and when this is the case a little brilliancy is
lost in the after-tinting.</p>

<p>As the Print is comparatively insensitive to light when
the excess of Nitrate has been washed away, it is not necessary
to darken the room; but a <i>bright light</i> proceeding
from an open door or window should be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>After using the salt or the Ammonia, soak the Prints
again for a minute or so in common water. Then place
them in the toning Bath of Gold and acid; do not put in
too many at once, and move them about occasionally, to
prevent spots of imperfect action at the point where the
sheets touch each other.</p>

<p>The foreign papers, plain salted, colour rapidly in two or
three minutes. English papers require five to ten minutes;
Albuminized, ten minutes to a quarter of an hour. The
tendency of the Gold Bath is to give a blue tone to the
image; hence proofs which are light red after using the
salt or Ammonia, become, first red-purple, and then violet-purple
in the Sel d'or. Albumen Prints assume some shade
of brown, or of purple if not too strongly Albuminized.
Ammonio-Nitrate papers highly salted, and prepared without
Citrate, become first dark purple, and then blue and
inky; the Citrate is intended to obviate this inky tint.</p>

<p>When the darkest tones are reached, the Bath produces
no further effect, but eventually (more especially if the
solution be not shielded from light [?]) there is a little
decomposition, producing a cream-coloured deposit upon
the lights.</p>

<p>The toning being completed, the Prints are again washed
for an instant in water, to remove the excess of gold solution.
This washing must not be continued longer than two
or three minutes, or there will be danger of yellowness of
the whites; this however ought not to happen with proper
precautions.</p>

<p>Lastly, the proofs are fixed in a solution of Hyposulphite
of Soda, one part to four of water; which may be used
many times successively. This Bath alters the tone very
little if the deposit of Gold be well fixed on the Print; but
the writer has often observed in the case of Albumen paper
and paper prepared with Citrate (Formula II.) that if removed
too quickly from the Sel d'or, the purple tones
change by immersion in the Hyposulphite to a chocolate-brown.
Ammonio-Nitrate Prints are less liable to alter in
this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>In order that the fixing may be properly performed, the
time of immersion should not be less than ten minutes with
a porous paper, plain salted; or fifteen minutes in the case
of an English or albuminized paper.</p>

<p>Ammonia may be used for fixing plain paper Prints;
about one part of the Liquor Ammoniæ, to four of water.
Ten minutes' immersion will usually be sufficient, and the
tone is very little affected. This process is a good one, but
the pungent smell of the Ammonia is an objection, and the
Bath discolours by use. Some care too is required in order
to ensure a proper fixing of the prints (see the remarks at
<a href="#Page_131">page 131</a>).</p>

<p>For directions to wash and mount the proofs, see
<a href="#Page_255">page 255</a>.</p>

<p>It will sometimes happen in the Sel d'or process, from
the toning Bath having but little solvent action on the light
shades, that the Prints, after being washed and dried, appear
too dark; this may be remedied by laying them for
a few minutes in <i>a very dilute solution</i> of Chloride of Gold
(five or six drops of the yellow solution of the Chloride to
a few ounces of water) and washing for an additional quarter
of an hour. Or an over-printed Positive may be saved by
toning it with Chloride of Gold instead of Sel d'or. In that
case, after proper removal of the free Nitrate of Silver, a
few drops of a lemon-yellow solution of Chloride of Gold
(with a fragment of Carbonate of Soda added to remove
acidity, <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>), should be poured over the Print, which is
to be subsequently fixed in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>Advantages of toning by Sel d'or.</i>&mdash;This process will be
found especially useful by those who print large Positives.
The solutions may be mixed in a few minutes, and, being
very dilute, are economical. It is not even necessary to
employ a <i>Bath</i> for toning, but if the Sel d'or solution be
prepared of about twice or three times the strength given
in the formula, it will be sufficient to pour a few drachms
upon the surface of the print. As the Gold solution is always
used soon after mixing, a uniform and permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
tint can be obtained; whereas the single fixing and toning
Bath of Gold and Hyposulphite loses much of its efficacy
by keeping, and <i>over-printing</i> of the proof is required in
proportion as the Bath becomes older.</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION IV.</p>

<p><i>On a mode of Printing enlarged and reduced Positives,
Transparencies, etc., from Collodion Negatives.</i></p>

<p>To explain the manner in which a Photograph may be
enlarged or reduced in the process of printing, it will be
necessary to refer to the remarks made at <a href="#Page_52">page 52</a>, on the
<i>conjugate foci</i> of lenses.</p>

<p>If a Collodion Negative be placed at a certain distance
in front of a Camera, and (by using a tube of black cloth)
the light be admitted into the dark chamber only through
the Negative, a reduced image will be formed upon the
ground glass; but if the Negative be advanced nearer, the
image will increase in size, until it becomes first equal to,
and then larger than, the original Negative; the focus becoming
more and more distant from the lens, or receding,
as the Negative is brought nearer.</p>

<p>Again, if a Negative portrait be placed in the Camera
slide, and the instrument being carried into a dark room,
a hole be cut in the window-shutter so as to admit light
through the Negative, the luminous rays, after refraction
by the lens, will form an image of the exact size of life
upon a white screen placed in the position originally occupied
by the sitter. These two planes, in fact, that of the
object and of the image, are strictly <i>conjugate foci</i>, and, as
regards the result, it is immaterial from which of the two,
anterior or posterior, the rays of light proceed.</p>

<p>Therefore in order to obtain a reduced or enlarged copy
of a Negative, it is necessary only to form an image of the
size required, and to project the image upon a sensitive
surface either of Collodion or paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>A good arrangement for this purpose may be made by
taking an ordinary Portrait Camera, and prolonging it in
front by a deal box blackened inside and with a double
body, to' admit of being lengthened out as required; or,
more simply, by adding a framework of wood covered in
with black cloth. A groove in front carries the Negative,
or receives the slide containing the sensitive layer, as the
case may be.</p>

<p>In <i>reducing</i> Photographs, the Negative is placed in front
of the lens, in the position ordinarily occupied by the object;
but in making an enlarged copy, it must be fixed
<i>behind</i> the lens, or, which is equivalent, the lens must be
turned round, so that the rays of light transmitted by the
Negative enter the back glass of the combination, and pass
out at the front. This point should be attended to in order
to avoid indistinctness of image from spherical aberration.</p>

<p>A Portrait combination of lenses of 2&frac12; or 3&frac14; inches
diameter is the best form to use, and the actinic and luminous
foci should accurately correspond, as any difference
between them would be increased by enlarging. A stop
of an inch or an inch and a half aperture placed <i>between</i>
the lenses obviates to some extent the loss of sharp outline
usually following enlargement of the image.</p>

<p>The light may be admitted through the Negative by
pointing the Camera towards the sky; or direct sunlight
may be used, thrown upon the Negative by a plane reflector.
A common swing looking-glass, if clear and free from
specks, does very well; it should be so placed that the
centre on which it turns is on a level with the axis of the
lens.</p>

<p>The best Negatives for printing enlarged Positives are
those which are distinct and clear; and it is important to
use a <i>small</i> Negative, which strains the lens less and gives
a better result than one of larger size. In printing by a 2&frac14;
lens for instance, prepare the Negative upon a plate about
two inches square, and afterwards enlarge it four diameters.</p>

<p>Paper containing Chloride of Silver is not sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sensitive to receive the image, and the Print should be
formed upon Collodion, or on iodized paper developed by
Gallic Acid (see <a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>).</p>

<p>The exposure required will vary not only with the intensity
of the light and the sensibility of the surface used,
but also <i>with the degree of reduction or enlargement of the
image</i>.</p>

<p>In printing upon Collodion the resulting picture is
Positive by transmitted light; it should be backed up
with white varnish, and then becomes Positive by reflected
light. The tone of the blacks is improved by treating the
plate first with Bichloride of Mercury, and then with Ammonia,
in the manner described at pages 113 and 207.</p>

<p>Mr. Wenham, who has written a paper on the mode of
obtaining Positives of the life size, operates in the following
way:&mdash;he places the Camera, with the slide containing
the Negative, in a dark room, and reflects the sunlight in
through a hole in the shutter, so as to pass first through
the Negative and then through the lens; the image is received
upon iodized paper, and developed by Gallic Acid,
in the mode described in the second Section of this Chapter
(<a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>).</p>

<p><i>On printing Collodion transparencies for the Stereoscope.</i>&mdash;This
may be done by using the Camera to form an image
of the Negative in the mode described in the last page;
but more simply by the following process:&mdash;Coat the glass,
upon which the Print is to be formed, with Collodio-Iodide
of Silver in the usual way; then lay it upon a piece of black
cloth, Collodion side uppermost, and place two strips of
paper of about the thickness of cardboard and one-fourth
of an inch broad, along the two opposite edges, to prevent
the Negative being soiled by contact with the film. Both
glasses must be <i>perfectly flat</i>, and even then it may happen
that the Negative is unavoidably wetted; if so, wash it
immediately with water, and if it be properly varnished,
no harm will result.</p>

<p>A little ingenuity will suggest a simple framework of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
wood, on which the Negative and sensitive plate are retained,
separated only by the thickness of a sheet of paper;
and the use of this will be better than holding the combination
in the hand.</p>

<p>The printing is conducted by the light of gas, or of a
camphine or moderator lamp; diffused daylight would be
too powerful.</p>

<p>The employment of a concave reflector, which may be
purchased for a few shillings, ensures parallelism of rays,
and is a great improvement. The lamp is placed in the
focus of the mirror, which may at once be ascertained by
moving it backwards and forwards until an evenly illuminated
circle is thrown upon a white screen held in front.
This in fact is one of the disadvantages of printing by a
naked flame&mdash;that the light falls most powerfully upon the
central part, and less so upon the edges, of the Negative.</p>

<p>The picture must be exposed for a longer or shorter time
(about ten seconds will be an average) according to its
behaviour during development (see p, 224); this process,
as well as the fixing, is conducted in the same manner as
for Collodion pictures generally.</p>

<p>Some adopt the plan of whitening by Corrosive Sublimate,
and again blackening by dilute Ammonia, as an improvement
to the colour of the dark shadows (see <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>).</p>

<p>If this mode of printing upon Collodion be conducted
with care, the Negative being separated from the film by
the smallest interval only, the loss of distinctness in outline
will scarcely be perceived.</p>

<p>Stereoscopic transparencies may also be printed by the
dry Collodion process described in Chapter VI., or by the
Collodio-Albumen process. Mr. Llewellyn recommends
the employment of a solution of Oxymel, so dilute that
the plate becomes nearly dry, and may be laid in contact
with the Negative without fear of injury (see the footnote
at <a href="#Footnote_54">page 302</a>).</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Imperfections in Negative and Positive Collodion
Photographs.</i></p>

<p>The following may be mentioned:&mdash;fogging&mdash;spots&mdash;
markings, etc.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">CAUSES OF FOGGING OF COLLODION PLATES.</p>

<p>1. <i>Over-exposure of the Plate.</i>&mdash;This is likely to happen
when using the full aperture of a double combination
lens for distant objects brightly illuminated, the Collodion
being highly sensitive. Also from the film being very
blue and transparent, with too little Iodide of Silver
(<a href="#Page_114">p. 114</a>).</p>

<p>2. <i>Diffused Light.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> In the developing room. This
is a frequent cause of fogging, and especially so when
the common yellow calico is employed, which is apt to
fade. Use a treble thickness, or procure the waterproof
material, in which the pores are stopped with gutta-percha.&mdash;<i>b.</i>
In the Camera. The slide may not fit accurately, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the door does not shut close. Throw a black cloth over
the Camera during the exposure of the plate.&mdash;<i>c.</i> From
direct rays of the sun or the light of the sky falling upon
the lens. With the full aperture of a double combination
Lens, a portion of sky included in the field (as for instance
to form the background of a portrait) is apt to cause fogging.
The portrait will probably be more brilliant if a
funnel-shaped canvas bag, or a curtain with an oblong
aperture admitting only the rays proceeding from the sitter,
be placed in front of the Camera.</p>

<p>3. <i>Alkalinity of the Bath.</i>&mdash;This condition, explained at
<a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>, may be due to one of the following causes:&mdash;<i>a.</i>
The use of Nitrate of Silver which has been too strongly
fused (<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>).&mdash;<i>b.</i> Constant employment of a Collodion containing
free Ammonia or Carbonate of Ammonia (<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>).&mdash;<i>c.</i>
Addition of Potash, Ammonia, or Carbonate of Soda
to the Nitrate Bath, in order to remove free Nitric Acid
(<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>).&mdash;<i>d.</i> Use of rain-water or hard water for making
the Nitrate Bath (rain-water usually contains traces of Ammonia;
hard water often abounds with Carbonate of Lime).</p>

<p>In either case the alkalinity may easily be removed by
the addition of Acetic Acid, one drop to four ounces of the
solution. The proper mode of testing for alkalinity is described
at <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Decomposition of the Nitrate Bath.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> By constant
exposure to light (the injurious effects of this will be mostly
seen when Positives are taken).&mdash;<i>b.</i> By organic matter:
this is sometimes present in Nitrate of Silver which has
been prepared from the residues of old Baths; or it may be
introduced by floating papers for the printing process upon
the Bath, or by dissolving the crystals of Nitrate of Silver
in putrid rain-water, or in impure distilled water collected
from the condensed water of steam-boilers and contaminated
with oily matter.&mdash;<i>c.</i> Decomposition of the Bath by
contact with metallic iron or copper, or with a fixing agent,
or a developing agent (<a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>).</p>

<p>5. <i>Faults of the developing solution.</i>&mdash;a. Brown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
decomposed solution of Pyrogallic Acid; this may sometimes
be used with impunity, but it tends, as a rule, to facilitate
irregular reduction of Silver.&mdash;h. Impure Acetic Acid having
a smell of Garlic and which probably contains Sulphur
in organic combination.&mdash;c. Omission of the Acetic Acid
in the developer: this will produce a universal blackness.</p>

<p>6. <i>Sundry other causes of fogging.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> Vapour of Ammonia
or Hydrosulphate of Ammonia, or the products of
the combustion of coal-gas, escaping into the developing
room.&mdash;<i>b.</i> Development of the image by immersion in solution
of Sulphate of Iron: this is a safe plan when the
films are formed in an acid Nitrate Bath; but with pale
films formed in a chemically neutral Bath it is better to
pour the fluid over the plate, and not to use the same portion
twice.&mdash;<i>c.</i> Redipping the plate in the Bath before development:
this is apt to give a foggy picture when using
an old Bath, and is not recommended.</p>

<p><i>Systematic plan of proceeding to detect the cause of the
fogging.</i>&mdash;If the amateur has had but little experience in
the Collodion process, and is using Collodion of moderate
sensitiveness and a new Bath, the probability is that the
fogging is caused by over-exposure. Having obviated this,
proceed to test the Bath; <i>if it is made from pure materials,
and does not restore the blue colour of a piece of litmus-paper
previously reddened by holding it over the mouth of
a glacial Acetic Acid bottle</i>, it may be considered in working
order.</p>

<p>Next prepare a sensitive plate, and after draining it for
two or three minutes in a dark place, pour on the developer:
wash, fix, and bring out to the light; if any mistiness
is perceptible, either the developing room is not sufficiently
dark, or the Bath was prepared with a bad sample
of Nitrate of Silver, or with impure Alcohol, or impure
water.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the plate remains absolutely clear
under these circumstances, <i>the cause of error may be in the
Camera</i>;&mdash;therefore prepare another sensitive film, place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
it in the Camera, and proceed exactly as if taking a picture,
with the exception of not removing the brass cap of
the lens: allow to remain for two or three minutes, and
then remove and develope as usual.</p>

<p>If no indication of the cause of the fogging is obtained
in either of these ways, there is every reason to suppose
that it is due to diffused Light gaining entrance through
the lens. This cause of error may often be detected by
looking into the Camera from the front, when an irregular
reflection will be seen upon the glass.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">SPOTS UPON COLLODION PLATES.</p>

<p>Spots are of two kinds: spots of opacity, which appear
black by transmitted light, and white by reflected light;
and spots of transparency, the reverse of the others, being
white when seen upon Negatives, and black on Positives.</p>

<p>Opaque Spots are referable to an excess of development
at the point where the spot is seen; they may be
caused by&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The use of Collodion holding small particles in suspension.</i>&mdash;Each
particle becomes a centre of chemical action,
and produces a speck, or a speck with a tail to it.
The Collodion should be placed aside to settle for several
hours, after which the upper portion may be poured off.</p>

<p>2. <i>Turbidity of the Nitrate solution.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> From flakes of
Iodide of Silver having fallen away into the solution, by
use of an over-iodized Collodion.&mdash;<i>b.</i> From a deposit formed
by degrees upon the sides of the gutta-percha trough.&mdash;<i>c.</i> From
the inside of the trough being dusty at the time
of pouring in the solution.</p>

<p>In order to obviate these inconveniences, it is well to
make at least half as much again of the Nitrate solution
as is necessary, and to keep it in a stock-bottle, from which
the upper part may be poured off when required. The
frequent filtration of Silver Baths is unadvisable, since the
paper employed may be contaminated with impurities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Dust upon the surface of the glass at the time of
pouring on the Collodion.</i>&mdash;Perfectly clean glasses, if set
aside for a few minutes, acquire small particles of dust;
each plate should therefore be gently wiped with a silk
handkerchief immediately before being used.</p>

<p>4. <i>Faults of the Slide.</i>&mdash;Sometimes a small hole exists,
which admits a pencil of light, and produces a spot, known
by its being always in the same part of the plate; occasionally
the door works too tightly so that small particles of
wood, etc., are scraped off, and projected against the plate
when it is raised. Or perhaps the operator, after the exposure
is finished, shuts down the door with a jerk, and so
causes a splash in the liquid which has drained down and
accumulated in the groove below; this cause, although not
a common one, may sometimes occur.</p>

<p>5. <i>Insoluble particles in the Pyrogallic Acid.</i>&mdash;The solution
of Pyrogallic Acid will not usually require filtering,
but if specks of Metagallic Acid are present, the developer
should be passed through blotting paper before use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spots of Transparency</span> may generally be traced to
some cause <i>which renders the Iodide of Silver insensible
to light at particular points</i>, so that on the application of
the developer no reduction takes place.</p>

<p>1. <i>Concentration of the Nitrate of Silver on the surface
of the film by evaporation.</i>&mdash;When the film becomes too
dry after removal from the Bath, the solvent power of the
Nitrate increases so much that it eats away the Iodide and
produces spots.</p>

<p>2. <i>Small particles of undissolved Iodide of Potassium in
the Collodion.</i>&mdash;These are likely to occur when Anhydrous
Ether and Alcohol are employed. They produce transparent
specks at every part of the plate. Allow the Collodion
to settle, or add a drop of water, which will dissolve the
Iodide.</p>

<p>3. <i>Alcohol or Ether containing too much water</i>.&mdash;This
causes a reticulated appearance of the film, which is rotten
and full of holes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>Use of glasses improperly cleaned.</i>&mdash;This cause is perhaps
the most frequent of all, when the film of Pyroxyline
is very thin and the Bath neutral. After glasses have been
long used it is often difficult to clean them so thoroughly
that the breath lies smoothly; but the use of Potash gives
the best chance.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">MARKINGS OF VARIOUS KINDS ON COLLODION PLATES.</p>

<p>1. <i>A reticulated appearance on the film after developing.</i>&mdash;When
this is universal, it often depends upon the employment
of Collodion containing water. Or, if not due to
this cause, the plate may have been immersed too quickly
in the Bath, and the soluble Pyroxyline partially precipitated.</p>

<p>2. <i>Oily spots or lines.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> From raising the plate out of
the Nitrate Bath before it has been immersed sufficiently
long to have become thoroughly wetted.&mdash;<i>b.</i> Removal of
the plate from the Bath before the Ether upon the surface
has been washed away.&mdash;<i>c.</i> Redipping the plate in the Nitrate
Bath after exposure to light, and pouring on the developer
<i>immediately</i>; if a few minutes be not allowed to
drain off the excess of Nitrate, the Pyrogallic Acid will
not amalgamate readily with the surface of the film.&mdash;<i>d.</i> From
the Nitrate Bath being covered with an oily scum,
which is carried down by the plate. Draw a slip of blotting-paper
gently along the surface of the liquid before
using it.</p>

<p>3. <i>Straight lines traversing the film horizontally.</i>&mdash;From
a check having been made in immersing the plate in the
Bath.</p>

<p>4. <i>Curved lines of over-development.</i>&mdash;By employing the
developer too concentrated; or by not pouring it on sufficiently
quickly to cover the surface before the action begins;
or by using too little Acetic Acid, and omitting the
Alcohol. The addition of Alcohol to the developer will
not be required as a rule when the Bath is newly made;
but when much Ether has accumulated in it, the developer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
has a tendency to run into oily lines, unless containing
Alcohol.</p>

<p>5. <i>Stains from too small a quantity of fluid having been
employed to develope the image.</i>&mdash;In this case, the whole
plate not being thoroughly covered during the development,
the action does not always proceed with regularity.</p>

<p>6. <i>Irregular striæ.</i>&mdash;From fragments of dried Collodion
accumulating in the neck of the bottle, and being washed
on the film; to avoid this, the finger should be passed
gently round the inside of the neck before use.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/pg282.png" width="105" height="47" alt="" />
</div>

<p>7. <i>Markings like those represented in the
woodcut.</i>&mdash;They are caused by using an inferior
sample of Pyroxyline made from too
hot acids, and are most seen when using an
old Bath.</p>

<p>8. <i>Stains on the upper part of the plate, from using a
dirty slide.</i>&mdash;To avoid these, place, if necessary, strips of
blotting-paper between the supports and the glass.</p>

<p>9. <i>Wavy marks at the lower parts of the plate.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> If
the Collodion is becoming thick and glutinous from constant
use, dilute it with a little Ether containing an eighth
part of Alcohol.&mdash;<i>b.</i> From reversing the direction of the
plate after its removal from the Bath, so that the Nitrate
of Silver flows back again over the surface and causes a
stain on the application of Pyrogallic Acid.&mdash;<i>c.</i> Impurities
on the woodwork of the frame ascending the film by capillary
attraction. This is a frequent source of stains.</p>

<p>10. <i>Marks from the developer not running up to the edge
of the film</i> (<a href="#Page_212">p. 212</a>). Remedy this as far as possible by
allowing the Collodion to set a little more firmly before
dipping the plate in the Bath.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">IMPERFECTIONS IN COLLODION NEGATIVES.</p>

<p>1. <i>A want of Intensity.</i>&mdash;a. From the development not
having been sufficiently pushed (<a href="#Page_224">p. 224</a>).&mdash;<i>b.</i> From the
Collodion film being too blue and transparent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Negatives.&mdash;<i>c.</i> The Collodion newly made from pure materials
(<a href="#Page_114">p. 114</a>).&mdash;<i>d.</i> The plate kept too long between exciting
and development (<a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>).&mdash;<i>e.</i> The Bath newly prepared
from commercial crystallized Nitrate of Silver (<a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>).&mdash;<i>f.</i>
The light too feeble, as on very dark wintry
days, or in copying interiors, etc.</p>

<p>2. <i>Inferior half-tones, with great intensity of the high
Lights.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> From the plate being insufficiently exposed.&mdash;<i>b.</i>
The Collodion of inferior quality, either too strongly
tinted with Iodine or made from impure materials.&mdash;<i>c.</i>
The Nitrate Bath old and partially decomposed.&mdash;<i>d.</i> The
light reflected too strongly from the object. When the
light is unusually bright, a feeble Collodion and a newly
mixed Nitrate Bath will be found to give better definition
in the high lights than an intense Collodion, which may
produce chalky Negatives.</p>

<p>3. <i>The image pale and misty.</i>&mdash;The plate is over-exposed
(if so, the image will probably be a reddish-brown colour
by transmitted light), or there is diffused light in the
Camera or developing room. The presence of Bromides
or Chlorides in the Collodion may occasionally produce the
same effect.</p>

<p>4. <i>The high lights of the image are solarized.</i>&mdash;A change
of colour to a light brown or red tint by transmitted light,
with a dark shade by reflected light, is favoured by over-exposure
of the plate, by organic decomposition of the
Collodion, and by Acetate of Silver and other organic
bodies in the Bath.</p>

<p>5. <i>The image dissolves off on applying the Cyanide of
Potassium.</i>&mdash;The Collodion is probably over-iodized. The
same thing may also happen in the Honey preservative
process, when the plates have been long kept and the indurated
layer of syrup not properly removed before applying
the developer.</p>

<p>6. <i>The developer does not run up to the edge of the film.</i>&mdash;This
is likely to occur when using Collodion nearly anhydrous;
and particularly so with a new Bath not containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
much Alcohol. The film will be less repellent, if a
longer time be allowed before dipping in the Bath.</p>

<p>7. <i>The film does not stick to the glass.</i>&mdash;Clean the plates
very carefully, and make the Collodion a little thinner if
required. Allow a longer time before dipping in the
Bath. A very effectual plan is to roughen the surface of
the plates, about an eighth of an inch round the edges.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">IMPERFECTIONS IN COLLODION POSITIVES.</p>

<p>The principal difficulty in the production of Negatives
is to ascertain the right time of exposure to light and the
proper point to which to carry the development of the
image. A minor amount of fogging, stains, etc., is of less
consequence, and will scarcely be noticed in the printing.</p>

<p>With direct Positives however the case is different.
The beauty of these pictures depends entirely upon their
being clean and brilliant, without fogging, specks, or imperfections
of any kind. On the other hand, the exposure
and development of Positives is comparatively simple and
easily ascertained.</p>

<p>1. <i>The shadows dark and heavy.</i>&mdash;The plate has not
received sufficient exposure in the Camera;&mdash;or the film
being very transparent and the Silver solution weak, Nitric
Acid is present in the Bath, or the Collodion is brown
from free Iodine; in the latter case make the Collodion a
little thicker, and develope with Sulphate of Iron in preference
to Pyrogallic Acid.</p>

<p>2. <i>The shadows good, but the lights overdone.</i>&mdash;The developing
fluid may have been kept on too long; or the object
is not properly illuminated (<a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>); or the Collodion
is not adapted for Positives.</p>

<p>3. <i>The high lights pale and flat, the shadows misty.</i>&mdash;The
plate is over-exposed. Indistinctness of outline caused
by over-exposure is distinguished from that produced by
fogging by holding the plate up to the light; in the former
case the image shows as a Negative.</p>

<p>If the Collodion is colourless, clearer shadows will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
probably be obtained by dropping in Tincture of Iodine until
a yellow colour is produced.</p>

<p>4. <i>The picture developes slowly; spangles of metallic
Silver are formed.</i>&mdash;Too much Nitric Acid is present in
proportion to the strength of the Bath, to the amount of
Iodide in the film, and to the quantity of Protosalt of Iron
in the developer (<a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a>).</p>

<p>5. <i>Circular spots of a black colour after hacking up with
the varnish.</i>&mdash;These are often caused by lifting the plate
too quickly out of the Bath; or by pouring on the developer
at one spot, so as to wash away the Nitrate of Silver;
or by the use of glasses imperfectly cleaned.</p>

<p>6. <i>The image becomes metallic on drying.</i>&mdash;If Sulphate
of Iron is employed, the solution is too weak, or free
Nitric Acid has been added in excess. If Pyrogallic Acid
is used to develope, the proportion of Nitric Acid is too
great.</p>

<p>7. <i>A green or blue tint in certain parts of the image.</i>&mdash;This
is caused by the deposit of Silver being too scanty,
which may happen from over-action of the light, or from
the film of Pyroxyline being <i>very thin</i>;&mdash;if the Collodion
is diluted down beyond a certain point, the same quantity
of free Nitrate of Silver is not retained upon the surface
of the film. Add a few drops of the Bath to the developer
before pouring it on the plate.</p>

<p>8. <i>Vertical lines, and mistiness, on the image.</i>&mdash;If the
Bath has been much used, add to it a third part of a simple
solution of Nitrate of Silver in water, without any Alcohol
or Iodide. Also prepare the developer with addition of
Alcohol, to make it flow more readily (<a href="#Page_211">p. 211</a>).</p>


<p class="caption3">SECTION II.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Imperfections in Paper Positives.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>The Print marbled and spotty.</i>&mdash;The quality of the
paper is often inferior, which causes it to imbibe liquids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
unevenly at different points; or the amount of Silver in
the Nitrate Bath is insufficient. In this case the spots are
often absent at the lower and most depending part of the
sheet, where the excess of liquid drains off.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Print clean on the surface, but spotted when held
up to the light.</i>&mdash;In this case the spots are probably due to
imperfect fixation (see <a href="#Page_129">p. 129</a>).</p>

<p>3. <i>The Print becomes pale in the Hyposulphite Bath, and
has a cold and faded appearance when finished.</i>&mdash;The Chloride
of Silver in the paper may have been in excess with
regard to the free Nitrate of Silver; which is especially
likely if no bronzing could be obtained by prolonged action
of the light, or if a weak solution of Nitrate of Silver was
laid on with a brush, or by a glass rod. Prints formed on
paper which has been kept too long after sensitizing present
the same appearance, the free Nitrate of Silver having
entered into combination with the organic matter.</p>

<p>4. <i>Yellowness of the light parts of the proof.</i>&mdash;The following
causes are likely to produce yellowness:&mdash;acidity
of the fixing and toning Bath (<a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>),&mdash;its action continued
for too long a time,&mdash;the first washings of the proof
not performed quickly,&mdash;the toning Bath laid aside until
it had become decomposed and nearly useless,&mdash;the paper
kept for several days after sensitizing.</p>

<p>A creamy yellowness is also common in Prints toned by
Sel d'or, when the Hydrochloric Acid has been omitted
from the formula; the proof exposed to light during the
toning and fixing process; or too long a time allowed to
elapse between the toning and fixing. It is also more frequently
met with on albuminized paper.</p>

<p>5. <i>Intense bronzing of the deep shadows.</i>&mdash;In this case
the Negative is in fault; remedy the evil as far as possible
by printing on paper containing but little salt.</p>

<p>6. <i>The definition of the Print imperfect, the Negative
being a good one.</i>&mdash;Much will depend upon the quality of
the paper. Towgood's Positive gives good definition. The
use of Albumen will be a great advantage. Citrate of Soda
(<a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a>) will also improve the definition on plain paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <i>Markings of a yellow tint in the dark portions of the
Positive.</i>&mdash;These are common on Prints toned without
Gold; care should be taken not to handle the paper too
much, either before or after sensitizing; to wash the prints
in a clean vessel; and not to lay them down whilst wet
on a wooden table or in contact with anything likely to
communicate impurities.</p>

<p>8. <i>Small specks and spots of different hinds.</i>&mdash;These,
when not corresponding to similar marks upon the Negative,
are usually due to metallic specks in the paper; or to
insoluble particles floating in the bath.</p>

<p>9. <i>Markings of the brush in Ammonio-Nitrate pictures.</i>&mdash;In
this case there is probably an excess of Ammonia,
which dissolves the Chloride of Silver. Add a little fresh
Nitrate of Silver, or use the Oxide of Silver dissolved in
Nitrate of Ammonia (<a href="#Page_249">p. 249</a>).</p>

<p>10. <i>Marbled stains on the surface of the Print.</i>&mdash;Draw
a strip of blotting-paper gently over the surface of the
Nitrate Bath before sensitizing the paper; and see that the
sheet does not touch the bottom of the dish.</p>

<p>11. <i>Streaks on Albuminized paper.</i>&mdash;Apply the Albumen
more rapidly and evenly to the paper. If this does not
succeed, add a little Ox-Gall (<a href="#Page_243">p. 243</a>).</p>

<p>12. <i>Removal of the Albumen from the paper during
sensitizing.</i>&mdash;The Nitrate Bath is probably alkaline (see

<p class="caption3">LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY ON PRESERVED COLLODION AND COLLODIO-ALBUMEN.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Collodion process may be applied with success to
landscape Photography; but as the plates become dry
and lose their sensitiveness shortly after their removal
from the Bath, the operator will require to provide himself
with a yellow tent or some portable vehicle in which the
operations of sensitizing and developing can be conducted.
As it is a point of great importance in the Collodion process
that the plate should receive exactly the right amount
of exposure in the Camera,&mdash;a few seconds more or less
sufficing to affect the character of the picture,&mdash;many will
submit to much trouble and inconvenience in order to
have the apparatus complete upon the spot at which the
view is taken.</p>

<p>The object of the "Collodion Preservative Processes"
is to maintain the sensitiveness of the film for a certain
length of time after it has been excited in the Bath. There
is some difficulty in doing this, because if the plate be
allowed to dry spontaneously, the solution of free Nitrate
of Silver upon the surface, becoming concentrated by
evaporation, eats away the Iodide of Silver, and produces
transparent spots.</p>

<p>Some operators have attempted to use a second plate of
glass in such a way as to enclose the sensitive film with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
intervening stratum of liquid. The difficulty however of
separating the glasses again without tearing the film, is
considerable.</p>

<p>In the process of Messrs. Spiller and Crookes, the property
possessed by certain saline substances of remaining
for a long time in a moist condition was turned to account.
Such salts are termed "deliquescent," and many of them
have so great an attraction for water that they absorb it
eagerly from the air: the solution having been formed,
the water cannot entirely be driven off except by the application
of a considerable heat.</p>

<p>More recently, Honey has been employed by Mr. Shadbolt.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
This substance can scarcely be termed deliquescent,
but it possesses, like other uncrystallizable sugars,
the property of remaining moist and sticky for a long
time. Honey is, according to the Author's views, superior
to inorganic deliquescent salts as a preservative agent,
from its possessing an affinity for Oxides of Silver, and
thus acting chemically in communicating organic intensity
to the image.&mdash;Collodion plates when kept long in a moist
and sensitive state often give a pale and blue image, even
although the Nitrate of Silver be left upon the film; and
neither Nitrate of Magnesia nor Glycerine appears capable
of supplying the deficient element, both being nearly
or quite indifferent to the Salts of Silver.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> A claim has lately been advanced by Mr. Maxwell Lyte to be considered
as the discoverer of the Honey Process. This gentleman appears to have
worked simultaneously with Mr. Shadbolt, and to have anticipated him in
publishing; but the object of Mr. Lyte's process was rather to increase the
sensibility of the plates than to confer upon them keeping qualities.</p></div>


<p class="caption4nb">THE HONEY AND OXYMEL KEEPING PROCESSES.</p>

<p>When the weather is cool, Collodion plates may be preserved
with tolerable certainty for a few hours, by simply
applying Honey to them in the state in which they are
taken from the Nitrate of Silver Bath.</p>

<p>The best pure Virgin Honey should be obtained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
dripping it immediately from the comb. This point is of
importance, since if the sample of honey be of inferior
quality, or adulterated, the process may not succeed. The
quantity of water to be added will vary with the consistence
of the honey, from about an equal bulk to two parts:
it should be sufficient to make the preservative solution
pass slowly through filtering-paper.</p>

<p>After the plate is removed from the Nitrate Bath, it is
to be drained and wiped on the back in the usual way. The
Honey is then poured along the edge in such a manner as
to form a broad wave which forces the Nitrate of Silver
solution before it and covers the film. Next drain the
plate into a measure and pour on a second portion of Honey
as before. This second dose may be used again for
the first application to the succeeding plate.</p>

<p>Lastly, stand the glass on blotting-paper in a dark place
for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and wipe
the lower edge before putting it into the plate box.</p>

<p>The exposure required will probably be about four or
five times as long as that for new and sensitive Collodion,
or twice as long as the exposure required for old and brown
Collodion.</p>

<p>Before applying the developer, immerse the plate in a
Bath of rain-water for five minutes, moving it about
occasionally to soften the honey. This will probably be
sufficient for plates which have not been kept longer than
four hours, and beyond that time the process is not considered
certain, since the Honey exercises a slow reducing
action upon the Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p>The solution of Pyrogallic Acid may be used of the ordinary
strength, with a full dose of Acetic Acid. Only a
faint image comes out at first, but on pouring over the
plate a fresh portion of the developer with two or three
drops of the Nitrate Bath added to each fluid drachm, it
may be intensified to any extent.</p>

<p>Fix with Hyposulphite of Soda, and wash in the usual
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>When the process fails, from heat of the weather or
other causes, the image will probably be feeble and red by
transmitted light, and the shadows defective and misty.
This is especially likely to happen when the Nitrate Bath
is very old and contains much Acetate of Silver; or when
the same portion of Honey is used more than once, and
has undergone partial decomposition by the action of the
Nitrate of Silver. The use of <i>pure</i> Honey, free from mouldiness
and fermentation, will, <i>in cool weather</i>, almost certainly
ensure success.</p>

<p><i>A modification of the process when the plates are to be
kept over four hours.</i>&mdash;In this case the whole, or the greater
part of the Nitrate of Silver must be removed before applying
the preservative agent. Wash the sensitive plate
in water in the manner described for the Oxymel process
in the next page. Then apply the syrup as before, using
it as thick as possible. Honeyed plates, free from Nitrate
of Silver, may commonly be kept for five or six days;
often much longer. Dr. Mansell, who has employed this
process with great success, speaks of <i>temperature</i> as a
point to be attended to. In hot weather the same length
of keeping properties will not be attained.</p>

<p><i>Use of Oxymel for preserving Collodion plates.</i>&mdash;The
principal difficulty in the employment of Honey in Photography,
is its disposition to ferment, or to become mouldy.
Fermentation occurs most readily in a dilute solution, and
will be obviated by using the syrup as thick and free from
water as possible. Mr. Llewellyn employs "Oxymel,"
which is a mixture of Honey and Vinegar, as a preservative
agent. This substance will keep even in dilute solution for
a long time without decomposition; and, being very readily
removed from the plates, does not interfere with the development
of the image. The preparation of Oxymel is described
in the Vocabulary, Part III.; it must be diluted
with three or four parts of water, and filtered.</p>

<p>Certain facts to which attention has been lately drawn
by Dr. Norris and Mr. Barnes in working with dry Collodion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
may be advantageously borne in mind when using
Oxymel; the preservative solution of which is employed in
so dilute a state that the process resembles to a great extent
a dry Collodion process. The observations above referred
to relate to the quality of the Collodion best adapted
for the purpose, and will be found at <a href="#Page_298">page 298</a>, to which
the reader is referred.</p>

<p>The manipulation of the Oxymel process is very simple.
Two flat gutta-percha dishes are provided, the one containing
common water and the other diluted and filtered Oxymel.
The Collodion plate, on its removal from the Bath,
is placed in the first dish, which is gently tilted up and
down, to wash away the free Nitrate of Silver. In a few
seconds, when the liquid is rendered milky, it is poured
away, and fresh water being introduced, the process is repeated
<i>until the oily lines disappear, and the surface of the
film becomes smooth and glassy</i>. The plate is then, after
a slight draining, removed to the second tray, and the
Oxymel waved backwards and forwards for about half a
minute, after which the glass is lifted out and placed vertically
on blotting-paper, which must be renewed when it
becomes wet and saturated.</p>

<p>The plates may be used any time within a fortnight
from the date of their preparation, and it is not necessary
to develope immediately after the exposure. The sensitiveness
will be considerably less than that of fresh Collodion:
from two to five minutes may be allowed with a Stereoscopic
view lens having a quarter-inch diaphragm.</p>

<p>Before developing, the film should be gently washed for
a few seconds with common water. Solution of Pyrogallic
Acid, of the ordinary strength, but previously mixed
with a portion of the Nitrate Bath solution, one or two
drops to each drachm, may then be poured on in the ordinary
way. Use less Nitrate of Silver and more Acetic
Acid in hot weather. When discoloration of the developer
occurs, mix a fresh portion and proceed as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4nb">PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN KEEPING
PROCESSES.</p>

<p>The plates must be roughened at the edges, and also
upon the surface, to make the film adhere.</p>

<p>It is advisable to use a tolerably thick Collodion, giving
a yellow film; the pale opalescent films being more easily
affected by markings on the glass, and not retaining so
much of syrup or Nitrate of Silver upon the surface.</p>

<p>The room in which the plates are prepared must be
carefully guarded from scattered pencils of white light;
the films are exposed to injury from this cause during the
whole of the time occupied in applying the preservative
syrup; and hence anything short of absolute chemical
darkness will be likely to cause fogging; especially so when
free Nitrate of Silver is left upon the film.</p>

<p>The water used for washing away the free Nitrate of
Silver before applying the preserving liquid, need not be
distilled. Common hard water containing Carbonates
and Chlorides, and producing <i>milkiness</i> with Nitrate of
Silver, will often suffice. The water of the New River
and of the River Thames, with which many parts of London
are supplied, may certainly be used; but in the case of
a very <i>hard</i> water, containing much Sulphate of Lime, it
might perhaps be advisable to substitute clean rain-water,
free from brown organic discoloration.</p>

<p>The preservative Oxymel must be carefully filtered, and
kept <i>covered</i>, in order to protect it from dust. It will also
be necessary occasionally, before using it, to run it through
a piece of white cambric, to stop back suspended particles,
which, if allowed to remain, would be a source of spots. If
it becomes mouldy, or discoloured by Silver, or ferments
and evolves gas, throw it away.</p>

<p>After the syrup is applied and the plates are drained,
stow them in a grooved box perfectly protected from light;
or place them in slides, which must be kept scrupulously
clean, since any trace of impurity would be likely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
produce a stain when the plate was left a long time in the
slide. If the preserved plates are kept in a cupboard or
box, see that no volatile matter, such as Ammonia, coal-gas,
etc., can find entrance.</p>

<p>In changing the plates after the exposure in the Camera,
use a large bag made of <i>several thicknesses</i> of black calico,
with a square of yellow calico let in at the top; an elastic
band securing it round the waist.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE COLLODIO-ALBUMEN PROCESS.</p>

<p>This process, the theory of which has been briefly explained
at <a href="#Page_181">page 181</a>, is more sensitive than the one last
described, and has the additional advantage of giving
<i>dry</i> plates, which do not attract dust, and are less liable
to injury. The details of manipulation are complex, but
this inconvenience is not so much felt when preparing a
large number of plates.</p>

<p><i>Cleaning the Glasses.</i>&mdash;Success will greatly depend upon
the mode in which this part of the process is performed.
The layer of Albumen which is applied to the Collodion film
tends to swell and to raise the latter in blisters; the most
effectual mode of obviating which will be to clean the glass
so that the film adheres with unusual tenacity.</p>

<p>The Liquor Potassæ of the Druggists, diluted with three
or four parts of water, and rubbed on the glass by a roll
of flannel (<a href="#Page_214">page 214</a>), is very effectual. A mixture of Tripoli-water
and Nitric Acid may however, if desired, be substituted:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lay the glass flat on a cloth, and rub the surface carefully
with a tuft of cotton-wool dipped in the Tripoli; then, before
the cream dries, wipe it off with a second tuft, and
polish with a third. Lastly, breathe upon the glass, and
having ascertained that it is chemically clean, apply the
Collodion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Coating with Collodion.</i>&mdash;Choose a rather thin Collodion
which adheres tightly to the glass. A preparation which
has been kept a long time after iodizing will usually
answer the purpose very well, and, as a rule, a non-contractile,
structureless Collodion is better than one which
is glutinous and wavy. The degree of sensibility of the
Collodion is not thought to have much influence upon the
result.</p>

<p><i>Coating the Plate.</i>&mdash;Apply the Collodion in the usual
manner, and allow it full time to set perfectly, before dipping
in the Bath, in order to favour its adherence to the
glass. With Collodion prepared from anhydrous spirits,
about half a minute may be given in cool weather.</p>

<p>Saturate with Iodide of Silver as described at <a href="#Page_204">page 204</a>, and
filter. An immersion of one minute will be sufficient; after
which, give the plate an up-and-down movement, and wash
it in plain water, in the manner advised for the Oxymel
preservative process, at <a href="#Page_292">page 292</a>. Then stand it on blotting-paper,
to drain for a minute or two, wipe the back of
the glass, and pour on the Albumen.</p>

<p>This Bath may become discoloured after a time; continue
to use it until it is of a dark sherry-colour, and then
treat it with "Kaolin," in the manner and with the precautions
advised at pages 91 and 245.</p>

<p><i>The Iodized Albumen.</i>&mdash;Procure eggs, fresh laid, or not
more than two or three days old. Separate the whites in
the same way as for Albuminized paper (<a href="#Page_241">p. 241</a>), and mix
by the following Formula:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The Iodide and Bromide should be free from Carbonate
of Potash, which is said to cause pin-holes in the Negatives.
To ensure the absence of this salt, dissolve the total quantity
of both Iodide and Bromide in the three ounces of
water advised in the formula; then, previously to adding
the Ammonia and Albumen, introduce <i>an excessively minute
particle of Iodine</i>, enough barely to colour the liquid.
The Iodine decomposes the Carbonate of Potash, but it
must not be used in excess, since free Iodine possesses
the property of coagulating Albumen. Iodide of Cadmium
also coagulates Albumen, so that the Iodides of Potassium
and Ammonium are the best.</p>

<p>Having mixed the ingredients in the order above given,
introduce them into a bottle, and shake it violently until
they have thoroughly amalgamated. Then transfer to a
tall narrow jar; allow to settle for twenty-four hours, and
draw off the upper clear portion for use. Particulars of
this part of the process have already been given under
the head of Albuminized Paper, to which the reader is referred
(<a href="#Page_241">p. 241</a>).</p>

<p>The ammoniacal solution of Albumen may be kept for
some time in a stoppered bottle without much decomposition.
If mucous threads form in it, filter through fine
linen.</p>

<p><i>Mode of applying the Albumen.</i>&mdash;Cover the moist film
with the Albumen in the same way as advised for Collodion
(<a href="#Page_216">p. 216</a>), pouring on at once a sufficient quantity to cause
it to spread in an even and undivided sheet; otherwise a
veined appearance may be produced, which will show in
the development. Return the excess of Albumen into the
bottle, and pour it once again upon the plate: the film
will remain clear and transparent, if the whole of the Nitrate
of Silver has been properly washed away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Collodion. Lastly, stand the plate nearly vertically on
blotting-paper to dry. This will occupy five or six hours;
but the process may be hastened by artificial heat.</p>

<p>After the Albumen solution has been used to coat a number
of plates successively, it becomes diluted with water;
the result of which is, that unequal intensity of image is
produced at the upper and lower edge of the film.</p>

<p>The iodized Albumen plates are at this stage of the process
nearly or quite insensitive to light, and may be preserved
unchanged for many weeks.</p>

<p><i>Sensitizing the Albumen film.</i>&mdash;When the plate has become
thoroughly dry, it is again introduced into the Bath
of Aceto-Nitrate of Silver, and allowed to remain for one
minute: then washed with water in the same manner as
before, but with even greater care, in order to obviate clouding
in the development. If blisters should form on drying,
it will be found useful to hasten the process by holding the
plates to the fire&mdash;or a hot iron may be placed in the centre
of a covered box and the glasses reared up round the sides.
They will thus dry quickly, and there will not be time for
the Albumen to swell much by imbibition.</p>

<p><i>Exposure in the Camera.</i>&mdash;This may be performed at
any period within a few weeks from the date of preparation
of the plates. For a landscape view with a small Stereoscopic
single lens, allow about three minutes in the winter,
or one minute and a half in the summer.</p>

<p><i>Development of the image.</i>&mdash;This can be deferred as long
as fourteen days after the exposure, with successful results.
Pour water over the plate until the film is thoroughly
wetted; then cover it with a solution of Pyrogallic Acid
containing one grain of the acid to the ounce of water,
and twenty minims of Glacial Acetic Acid. Two drops of
a neutral solution of Nitrate of Silver made with forty
grains of Nitrate to the ounce of water must be previously
added to each fluid drachm of the Pyrogallic. The
development, in the case of a landscape view taken with
sunlight, commences almost immediately, and may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
completed in about ten minutes, but the time occupied in developing
will vary greatly with the length of exposure, the
quantity of Nitrate of Silver, and the nature of the subject
copied&mdash;a badly lighted interior, for instance, often taking
an hour or longer to appear in all its details. If the developer
should discolour before the proper intensity has
been obtained, pour it off and mix a fresh quantity.</p>

<p><i>Fixing the image.</i>&mdash;Hyposulphite of Soda (one ounce to
four of water) will be found preferable to the Cyanide of
Potassium, as the latter has a solvent effect upon the
Albumen. An unusually long time will be required, as
the fixing agent must penetrate the Albumen, to reach the
Collodion beneath.</p>

<p>Careful washing in water for five or ten minutes removes
the excess of Hyposulphite, and the plate may then
be varnished in the usual way.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE DRY COLLODION PROCESS.</p>

<p>The earlier attempts to employ sensitive Collodion plates
in a desiccated condition were unsuccessful. The film of
Pyroxyline shrinks on drying, and becomes almost impervious
to moisture: hence, the developing solution not penetrating
properly, density cannot easily be obtained. We
are indebted to Dr. Hill Norris, of Birmingham, for establishing
the theory of the subject upon a more correct
basis. He has pointed out the importance of distinguishing
two different conditions of the Collodion surface,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> viz. the
<i>contractile</i>, common in newly-mixed Collodion,&mdash;and the
<i>short</i> or <i>powdery</i>, in Collodion which has been iodized with
the alkaline Iodides, and kept until much Iodine has been
set free. The latter is the most suitable condition for the
dry process; and the practical mode of distinguishing between
them is by sensitizing a plate and passing the finger
across it; if it can be easily pushed away in a firm and
connected skin, it will be unfit for the purpose required.
In order still further to preserve the film in a condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
permeable by the developer, it is recommended to coat it
whilst moist with a solution of Gelatine.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> See these states of the film more fully described at <a href="#Page_83">page 83</a>.</p></div>

<p>The dry Collodion process, although less sensitive, is
more simple than that on Collodio-Albumen, and possesses
many of its advantages; but it is less universally applicable,
since it depends entirely for success upon the peculiar
state of the Collodion, resembling in this respect the Oxymel
process already described.</p>

<p><i>Mode of preparing the plates.</i>&mdash;The glasses are coated
with the Collodion in the usual way. Blistering during
development being liable to happen in this process as in the
last, every care must be taken to make the films adhere
with the greatest possible tenacity, both by cleaning the
glasses with extra care (see <a href="#Page_294">p. 294</a>), and also by allowing
the Collodion to set firmly before dipping in the Bath. The
plate may be held from twenty to thirty seconds previous
to immersion, or even longer, provided the film, when lifted
out of the Bath, appears of uniform thickness throughout
(see <a href="#Page_218">page 218</a>).</p>

<p>The sensitizing having been completed, wash the plates
with plain water, exactly in the same way as for Oxymel
(<a href="#Page_292">p. 292</a>). If Nitrate of Silver be left, clouding will take
place in the process of development. After washing, drain
for a few seconds, and immerse in the solution of Gelatine.</p>

<p>To prepare this Bath, take of</p>

</table>

<p>Put the Gelatine in the cold water, and allow it a quarter
of an hour to soften and swell; it will then readily dissolve
on applying a gentle heat. This may be done in a glazed
saucepan or a pipkin of earthenware, taking care not to
scorch the bottom part by too strong a heat. Next clarify
the solution by adding to it, whilst barely warm, a tea-spoonful
of white of egg (previously beaten up with a
silver fork), and afterwards heating nearly to the boiling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
point. The Alcohol must now be added, to facilitate the
coagulation of the Albumen. When this takes place and
the liquid becomes clear, filter through a clean piece of
cambric folded three or four times. If a hot water filtering
apparatus can be obtained, the solution may be made to
pass through <i>paper</i>; but as it tends to gelatinize on cooling,
the ordinary mode of filtration commonly fails. The quantity
of Alcohol in the above formula is greater than is
usually recommended, allowance having been made for a
partial evaporation of the spirit.</p>

<p>The filtered liquid may be poured into a flat porcelain
dish, or a vertical trough, but in either case it will be necessary
to stand the vessel in warm water, in order to prevent
gelatinization.</p>

<p>The Collodion plate, thoroughly washed, is to be immersed
in this solution and moved up and down for two or
three minutes. It is then removed, drained on blotting-paper,
and dried. The use of artificial heat in drying will be
found a great advantage; it prevents the gelatine from settling
unequally upon the plate. Those who possess an apparatus
made purposely for drying plates by hot air, will
experience no difficulty, but an ordinary deal trunk may be
made to answer, with a little management. Cover the bottom
of the box with blotting-paper, and having heated one
or two "flat irons," place them in the centre: then range
the glasses side by side, with the coated surface looking inwards;
in a quarter of an hour, or from that to twenty minutes,
the desiccation will be complete. If the Collodion
plates are prepared in a room containing a fire, they may
be reared up side by side at a distance of two or three
feet, and in that way may be safely dried without fear of
injury, provided white light be excluded.</p>

<p>When dry they can be stowed away in a box; all the
precautions given at <a href="#Page_293">page 293</a> being observed. The sensibility
remains good for many days, possibly for weeks or
months in cold weather.</p>

<p><i>Exposure in the Camera.</i>&mdash;Allow from four to eight times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the exposure of the most sensitive moist Collodion. On a
clear summer's day, a sun-lit view may require one minute
or a minute and a half, with a short focus Stereoscopic
lens, having a diaphragm of a quarter of an inch diameter.
The average time however with the same lens would
be about twice as much, viz. three minutes.</p>

<p><i>Development of the Image.</i>&mdash;Make a saturated solution
of Gallic Acid in water by the directions given at <a href="#Page_261">page 261</a>.
Then dissolve forty grains of pure Nitrate of Silver in one
ounce of distilled water. Pour into a flat porcelain
dish a sufficient quantity of the Gallic Acid solution to
flood the plate readily. Then measure it, and to each fluid
ounce add <i>ten minims</i> of the solution of Silver, or five minims
in hot weather. It is important that no discoloration
should occur on mixing these liquids together, to obviate
which, observe the following precautions:&mdash;Clean the
porcelain vessel very carefully with Nitric Acid or Cyanide
before use. Employ a pure solution of Nitrate of Silver;
and mix it with the Gallic Acid, in preference to adding
the Gallic Acid to the Silver solution (read the remarks at
<a href="#Page_179">p. 179</a>).</p>

<p>The picture may be expected to appear in five or ten
minutes, and in one hour, or from that to four hours
(<a href="#Page_298">p. 298</a>), the development will be complete. It will not be
necessary to keep the plates in motion, but simply to lay
them side by side in the solution of the Gallic Acid. If in
spite of all precautions the developer begins to blacken before
the intensity has reached the proper point, it must be
poured off and a fresh mixture prepared. This however
will not often happen.</p>

<p>Lastly, when a full amount of opacity has been obtained,
wash the plate with water, and fix it in a solution of Hyposulphite
of Soda, or dilute solution of Cyanide of Potassium.</p>

<p><i>Failures in the process.</i>&mdash;Stains in the development may
arise from using dirty dishes, or glasses which have been
left in Gallo-Nitrate of Silver and improperly cleaned. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
must be borne in mind that these impurities are not visible
to the eye, although they produce the effect of discolouring
the developer. A thorough cleansing with strong Nitric
Acid or Potash will prove a remedy.</p>

<p>Blisters, unless of large size, may often be disregarded,
as they disappear on drying. General cloudiness may depend
upon the film having been imperfectly washed. Irregular
reduction at certain parts may be due to the Gelatine
setting before the plate has become dry, or to stains
produced by the finger applied to the upper edge of the
plate.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54" id="Footnote_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Since the above was written, Mr. Maxwell Lyte has communicated to
the 'Photographic Journal' (vol. iii.) a dry process in which a <i>modified</i> Gelatine
is used. The change is produced by boiling a solution of gelatine with
dilute Sulphuric Acid, which is afterwards neutralized and removed by
means of chalk. The result is to destroy the gelatinizing property of the
animal substance; the solution retains its fluidity on cooling, and the necessity
of employing artificial heat in drying the plates is avoided.</p>

<p class="caption4nb">ON THE BINARY COMPOUNDS OF THE ELEMENTS.</p>

<p>Many of the elementary bodies exhibit a strong tendency
to combine with each other, and to form compounds,
which differ in properties from either of their constituent
elements. This attraction, which is termed "Chemical
Affinity," is exerted principally between bodies which are
opposed to each other in their general characters. Thus,
taking for example the elements Chlorine and Iodine&mdash;they
are analogous in their reactions, and therefore there
is but little attraction between them, whereas either of
the two combines eagerly with Silver, which is an element
of a different class. So, again. Sulphur unites with the
metals, but two metallic elements are comparatively indifferent
to each other.</p>

<p>Oxygen is by far the most important in the list of chemical
elements. It combines with all the others, with the
single exception, perhaps, of Fluorine. The attraction, or
chemical affinity, however, which is exerted, varies much,
in different cases. The metals, as a class, are easily oxidized;
whilst many of the non-metallic elements, such as
Chlorine, Iodine, Bromine, etc., exhibit but little affinity
for Oxygen. Nitrogen is also a peculiarly negative element,
showing little or no tendency to unite with the
others.</p>

<p>Classification of binary compounds containing Oxygen.&mdash;When
one simple element unites with another, the product
is termed a "binary" compound.</p>

<p>There are three distinct classes of binary compounds of
Oxygen:&mdash;Neutral Oxides, basic Oxides, and acid Oxides.</p>

<p>Neutral and basic Oxides.&mdash;Take as examples&mdash;the
Oxide of Hydrogen, or Water, a neutral Oxide; the Oxide
of Potassium, or Potash, a basic Oxide.</p>

<p>Water is termed a neutral oxide, because its affinities
are low, and it is comparatively indifferent to other bodies.
Potash and Oxide of Silver are examples of basic oxides;
but there is a great difference between the two in chemical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
energy, the former belonging to a superior class of bases,
viz. the alkaline.</p>

<p>By studying the properties of an alkali (such as Potash
or Soda) which are familiar to all, we gain a correct
notion of the whole class of basic oxides. An alkali is a
substance readily soluble in water, and yielding a solution
which has a slimy feel from its solvent action upon
the skin. It immediately restores the blue colour of
reddened litmus, and changes the blue infusion of cabbage
to green. Lastly, it is neutralized and loses all its
characteristic properties upon the addition of an acid.</p>

<p>The <i>weaker bases</i> are, as a rule, sparingly or not at all
soluble in water, neither have they the same caustic and
solvent action upon the skin; but they restore the colour
of reddened litmus, and neutralize acids in the same manner
as the more powerful bases, or alkalies.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Acid</span> <i>Oxides.</i>&mdash;This class, taking the stronger acids
as the type, may be described as follows:&mdash;very soluble in
water, the solution possessing an intensely sour taste, and
a <i>corroding</i> rather than a solvent action upon the skin;
changes the blue colour of litmus and other vegetable
substances to red, and neutralizes the alkalies and basic
oxides generally.</p>

<p>Observe however that these properties are possessed in
very various degrees by different acids. Prussic Acid and
Carbonic Acid, for instance, are not sour to the taste, and
being feeble in their reactions, redden litmus scarcely or
not at all. All acids however, without any exception, tend
to combine with bases and to neutralize themselves; so
that this may be said to be the most characteristic property
of the class.</p>

<p><i>Chemical composition of Acid and Basic Oxides contrasted.</i>&mdash;It
is a law commonly observed, although with
many exceptions, that bases are formed by the union of
Oxygen with <i>metals</i>; and acids, by Oxygen uniting with
<i>non-metallic elements</i>. Thus, Sulphuric Acid is a compound
of Sulphur and Oxygen; Nitric Acid, of Nitrogen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and Oxygen. But the alkali, Potash, is an oxide of the
<i>metal</i> Potassium; and the oxides of Iron, Silver, Zinc,
etc. are bases, and not acids.</p>

<p>Again, the composition of acids and bases is different
in another respect; the former invariably contain more
Oxygen in proportion to the other element than the latter.
Taking the same examples as before, the two classes may
be represented thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The class of Hydrogen Acids.&mdash;Oxygen is so essentially
the element which forms the acidifying principle of
acids, that its very name is derived from that fact (&#959;&#958;&#965;&#962;,
acid, and &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945;&#969;, to generate). Still there are exceptions
to this rule, and in some acids <i>Hydrogen</i> appears to play
the same part; the <i>Hydracids</i>, as they are termed, are
formed principally by Hydrogen uniting with elements
like Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, Fluorine, etc. Thus, Muriatic
or Hydrochloric Acid contains Chlorine and Hydrogen;
Hydriodic Acid contains Iodine and Hydrogen.</p>

<p>Observe, however, that the position held by the Hydrogen
in these compounds, is different from that of the Oxygen
in the "Oxyacids," as regards the number of atoms
usually present; thus&mdash;</p>

the <i>basic</i> oxides, in containing a single atom of each constituent.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">THE TERNARY COMPOUNDS OF THE ELEMENTS.</p>

<p>As the various elementary substances unite with each
other to form Binary Compounds, so these binary compounds
again unite and form <i>Ternary</i> Compounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Compound bodies however do not, as a rule, unite with
simple elements. In illustration, take the action of Nitric
Acid upon Silver, described at <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>. No effect is produced
upon the metal until <i>Oxygen</i> is imparted; then the
Oxide of Silver so formed dissolves in the Nitric Acid.
In other words, it is necessary that a binary compound
should be first formed, before the solution can take place.
The mutual attraction or chemical affinity exhibited by
compound bodies is, as in the case of elements, most
strongly marked when the two substances are opposed to
each other in their general properties.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>acids</i> do not unite with other acids, but they
combine instantly with <i>alkalies</i>; the two mutually neutralizing
each other and forming "a salt."</p>

<p><i>Salts</i> therefore are ternary compounds produced by the
union of acids and bases; common Salt, formed by neutralizing
Muriatic Acid with Soda, being taken as the type
of the whole class.</p>

<p><i>General characters of the Salts.</i>&mdash;An aqueous solution
of Chloride of Sodium, or common Salt, possesses those
characters which are usually termed saline; it is neither
sour nor corrosive, but, on the other hand, has a cooling
agreeable taste. It produces no effect upon litmus and
other vegetable colours, and is wanting in those energetic
reactions which are characteristic of both acids
and alkalies; hence, although formed by the union of two
binary compounds, it differs essentially in properties from
both.</p>

<p>All salts however do not correspond to this description
of the properties of Chloride of Sodium. The Carbonate
of Potash, for instance, is an acrid and alkaline salt, and
the Nitrate of Iron reddens litmus-paper. A perfectly neutral
salt is formed when a strong acid unites with an energetic
base; but if, of the two constituents, one is more
powerful than the other, the properties of that one are
often seen in the resulting salt. Thus the Carbonate of
Potash is <i>alkaline</i> to test-paper, because the Carbonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Acid is feeble in its reactions; but if <i>Nitric Acid</i> and
<i>Potash</i> are brought together, then a Nitrate of Potash is
produced, which is neutral in every sense of the term.</p>

<p>The Chloride of Sodium and salts of a similar kind are
freely soluble in water, but all salts are not so. Some dissolve
only sparingly, and others not at all. The Chloride
and Iodide of Silver are examples of the latter class; they
are not bitter and caustic like the Nitrate of Silver, but
are perfectly tasteless from being insoluble in the fluids of
the mouth.</p>

<p>It is seen therefore from these examples, and many
others which might be adduced, that the popular notion of
a saline body is far from being correct, and that, in the language
of strict definition, any substance is a salt which is
produced by the union of an acid with an alkali, independent
of the properties it may possess.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>Cyanide of Potassium</i> is a true salt, although highly
poisonous; Nitrate of Silver is a salt; the green Sulphate
of Iron is a salt; so also is Chalk or Carbonate of Lime,
which has neither taste, colour, nor smell.</p>

<p><i>On the "Hydracid" class of Salts.</i>&mdash;The distinction between
Oxyacids and Hydracids has already been pointed
out (<a href="#Page_309">p. 309</a>), the latter having been shown to consist of Hydrogen
united with elements analogous in their reactions
to Chlorine, Iodine, Bromine, etc.</p>

<p>In a salt formed by an Oxygen Acid, both the basic and
acid elements appear. Thus the common Nitre, which is
a Nitrate of Potash, is found by analysis to contain Oxide
of Potassium as a base, in a state of combination with
Nitric Acid. But if a salt be formed by neutralizing an
alkali with a <i>Hydrogen Acid</i>, the product in that case does
not contain all the elements. This is seen from the following example:&mdash;</p>

<p>Observe that the Hydrogen and Oxygen, being present
in the correct proportions, unite to form Water, which is
an Oxide of Hydrogen. This water passes off when the
solution is evaporated, and leaves the dry crystals of salt.
On the other hand, with the Oxyacid Salts, the elementary
Hydrogen being absent, no water is formed, and the
Oxygen remains.</p>

<p>It must therefore be borne in mind that salts like the
Chlorides, Bromides, Iodides, etc. contain only <i>two</i> elements;
but that in the Oxyacid Salts, such as Sulphates,
Nitrates, Acetates, <i>three</i> are present. Thus, Nitrate of
Silver consists of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Silver, but Chloride
of Silver contains simply Chlorine and metallic Silver
united, without Oxygen.</p>

<p>The Hydracid salts however, when decomposed, yield
products similar to the Oxyacid salts. For instance, if
Iodide of Potassium be dissolved in water, and dilute Sulphuric
Acid added, this acid, being powerful in its chemical
affinities, tends to appropriate to itself the alkali; but it
does not remove <i>Potassium</i> and liberate <i>Iodine</i>, but takes
the <i>Oxide</i> of Potassium and sets free <i>Hydriodic Acid</i>, In
other words, as an atom of water is produced during the
<i>formation</i> of a Hydracid Salt, so is an atom destroyed
and made to yield up its elements in the <i>decomposition</i> of
a Hydracid Salt.</p>

<p>The reaction of dilute Sulphuric Acid upon Iodide of
Potassium may be stated thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Illustrations amongst Binary Compounds.</i>&mdash;If a few
drops of solution of Potash be added to solution of Nitrate
of Silver, a brown deposit is formed, which is the Oxide
of Silver, sparingly soluble in water. That is to say, as
a stronger metal displaces <i>metallic Silver</i>, so does an oxide
of the same metal displace <i>Oxide of Silver</i>. Therefore
bases like the alkalies, alkaline earths, etc. cannot exist in
a free state in solutions of the salts of weaker bases,&mdash;a
liquid containing Nitrate of Silver could not also contain
free Potash or Ammonia.</p>

<p>In the list given at <a href="#Page_306">page 306</a>, the metallic elements are
arranged principally in the order of their chemical affinities;
those of Potassium, Sodium, Barium, etc. being the
most marked.</p>

<p>As the alkalies displace the weaker bases from their

<p>In the list of acids. Sulphuric Acid is usually placed
first as being the strongest, and Carbonic Acid, which is
a gaseous substance, last. The vegetable acids, such as
Acetic, Tartaric, etc., are <i>intermediate</i>, being weaker than
the mineral acids, but stronger than Carbonic, or Hydrocyanic
Acid.</p>

<p><i>The order of decompositions affected by the insolubility
or the volatility of the products which may be formed.</i>&mdash;It
might be inferred from remarks already made, that on
mixing saline solutions, a gradual interchange of elements
would take place, until the strongest acids were associated
with the strongest bases, and <i>vice versâ</i>. There are many
causes however which interfere to prevent this; one of
which is <i>volatility</i>.&mdash;-</p>

<p>The violent effervescence which takes place on treating
a <i>Carbonate</i> of any kind with an acid is due to the <i>gaseous</i>
nature of Carbonic Acid and its escape in that form, which
greatly facilitates the decomposition.</p>

<p><i>Insolubility</i> is also a cause which exercises a great influence
on the result which will follow in mixing solutions.
If the formation of an insoluble substance is possible by
any interchange of elements, it will take place. A solution
of Chloride of Sodium added to Nitrate of Silver
invariably produces Chloride of Silver; the <i>insolubility</i> of
Chloride of Silver being the cause which determines its
formation.</p>

<p>So again, Sulphate of Lead and Protonitrate of Iron
are produced by mixing Nitrate of Lead with Sulphate of
Iron; but if Nitrate of <i>Potash</i> be substituted for Nitrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of Lead, the result is uncertain, because there are no elements
present which can, by interchanging, form an insoluble
salt; Sulphate of Potash, although <i>sparingly</i> soluble
in water, not being <i>insoluble</i>, like the Sulphate of Lead or
the Sulphate of Baryta.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ON CHEMICAL NOMENCLATURE.</p>

<p>The nomenclature of the chemical <i>elements</i> is mostly
independent of any rule; but an attempt has been made
to obviate this in the case of those of later discovery.
Thus the names of the newly-found <i>metals</i> usually end in
<i>um</i>, as Potassium, Sodium, Barium, Calcium, etc.; and
those elements which possess analogous characters have
corresponding terminations assigned to them, as Chlorine,
Bromine, Iodine, Fluorine, etc.</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature of Binary Compounds.</i>&mdash;These are often
named by attaching the termination <i>ide</i> to the more important
element of the two; as, the Ox<i>ide</i> of Hydrogen,
or Water; the Chlor<i>ide</i> of Silver; the Sulph<i>ide</i> of Silver.
Binary compounds of Sulphur however are sometimes
termed Sulphurets, as the <i>Sulphuret</i> or the <i>Sulphide</i> of
Silver indifferently.</p>

<p>When the same body combines with Oxygen, or the
corresponding element, in more than one proportion, the
prefix <i>proto</i> is applied to that containing the least Oxygen;
<i>sesqui</i> to that with once and a half as much as the
<i>proto</i>; <i>bi</i> or <i>bin</i> to that with twice as much; and <i>per</i> to
the one containing the most Oxygen of all. As examples,
take the following:&mdash;The Protoxide of Iron; the Sesquioxide
of Iron: the Protochloride of Mercury; the Bichloride
of Mercury. In these examples the Sesquioxide
of Iron is also a <i>Per</i>oxide, because no higher simple oxide
is known, and the Bichloride of Mercury is a <i>Per</i>chloride
for a similar reason.</p>

<p>When an inferior compound is discovered, it is often
termed <i>sub</i>; as the Suboxide of Silver, the Subchloride
of Silver. These bodies contain the least known quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of Oxygen and Chlorine respectively, and are hence entitled
to the prefix <i>proto</i>; but being of minor importance,
they are excepted from the general rule.</p>

<p>The combinations of metallic elements with each other
are termed "alloys;" or if containing Mercury, "amalgams."</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature of binary Compounds possessing acid
properties.</i>&mdash;These are named on a different principle.
The termination <i>ic</i> is applied to one element. Thus, taking
as an illustration the liquid known as "Oil of Vitriol," it
is truly an <i>Oxide</i> of Sulphur, but as it possesses strong
acid properties it is termed Sulphur<i>ic</i> Acid. So Nitric
Acid is an Oxide of Nitrogen; Carbonic Acid is an Oxide
of Carbon, etc. When there are two oxides of the same
element, both possessing acid properties, the most important
has the termination <i>ic</i>, and the other <i>ous</i>; as Sulphuric
Acid, Sulphur<i>ous</i> Acid; Nitric Acid, Nitr<i>ous</i> Acid.</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature of the Hydracids.</i>&mdash;The Hydrogen Acids
are distinguished from Oxyacids by retaining the names
of both constituents, the termination <i>ic</i> being annexed as
usual. Thus, <i>Hydro</i>chloric Acid, or the Chloride of Hydrogen;
<i>Hydr</i>iodic Acid, or the Iodide of Hydrogen.</p>

<p><i>Further illustrations of the nomenclature of Binary
Compounds.</i>&mdash;The Oxides of Nitrogen, and also of Sulphur,
afford an interesting illustration of the principles of
nomenclature. The former are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In this case the Sulphuric and Sulphurous Acids had
become familiarly known before the others, intermediate
in composition, were discovered. Hence, to avoid the confusion
which would result from changing the nomenclature,
the new bodies are termed <i>Hypo</i>sulphuric and <i>Hypo</i>sulphurous
(from &#8017;&#960;&#959;, <i>under</i>).</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature of Salts.</i>&mdash;Salts are named according to
the acid they contain; the termination <i>ic</i> being changed
into <i>ate</i>, and <i>ous</i> into <i>ite</i>. Thus, Sulphuric Acid forms
Sulph<i>ates</i>; Nitric Acid, Nitr<i>ates</i>; but Sulphur<i>ous</i> Acid
forms Sulph<i>ites</i>, and Nitrous Acid, Nitr<i>ites</i>.</p>

<p>In naming a salt, the base is always placed <i>after</i> the
acid, the term <i>oxide</i> being omitted; thus. <i>Nitrate of Oxide
of Silver</i> is more shortly known as "Nitrate of Silver,"
the presence of Oxygen being understood.</p>

<p>When there are two oxides of the same base, both of
which are <i>salifiable</i>,&mdash;in naming the salts, the term <i>proto</i>
is prefixed to the acid of the salt formed by the lowest,
and per to that of the higher oxide; as, the <i>Proto</i>sulphate
of Iron, or Sulphate of the Protoxide; the <i>Per</i>sulphate of
Iron, or Sulphate of the Peroxide.</p>

<p>Many salts contain more than one atom of acid to each
atom of base. In that case, the usual prefixes expressive
of quantity are adopted: thus, the <i>Bi</i>sulphate of Potash
contains twice as much Sulphuric Acid as the neutral
Sulphate, etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are salts in which the base is
in excess with regard to the acid, and which are usually
known as "basic salts;" thus, the red powder which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
deposits from solution of Sulphate of Iron, is a <i>basic</i> Persulphate
of Iron, or a Sulphate of the Peroxide of Iron
with more than the normal proportion of oxide.</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature of the Hydracid Salts.</i>&mdash;The composition
of these salts being different from those formed by Oxygen
Acids, the nomenclature varies also. Thus, in neutralizing
Hydrochloric Acid with Soda, the product formed is not
known as Hydrochlorate of Soda, but as <i>Chloride of Sodium</i>;
this salt, and others of a similar constitution, being
<i>binary</i>, and not <i>ternary</i>, compounds. The salt produced
by Hydrochloric Acid and <i>Ammonia</i> however is often
called "Muriate or Hydrochlorate of Ammonia," although
more strictly it should be the <i>Chloride of Ammonium</i>.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ON SYMBOLIC NOTATION.</p>

<p>The list of symbols employed to represent the various
elementary bodies is given at <a href="#Page_306">page 306</a>.&mdash;Commonly the
initial letter of the Latin name is used, a second or smaller
letter being added when two elements correspond in their
initials: thus C stands for Carbon, Cl for Chlorine, Cd for
Cadmium, and Cu for Copper.</p>

<p>The chemical symbol however does not simply represent
a particular element; it denotes also a definite weight,
or equivalent proportion, of that element. This will be
explained more fully in the succeeding pages, when speaking
of the Laws of Combination.</p>

<p><i>Formulæ of Compounds.</i>&mdash;In the <i>nomenclature</i> of compounds
it is usual to place the Oxygen or analogous element
<i>first</i> in the case of binary compounds, and the acid
before the base in the ternary compounds, or salts; but
in representing them <i>symbolically</i> this order is reversed:
thus, Oxide of Silver is written AgO, and never as OAg;
Nitrate of Silver as AgO NO<sub>5</sub>, not NO<sub>5</sub>AgO.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of symbols expresses combination;
thus, FeO is a compound of one proportion of Iron with
one of Oxygen, or the "Protoxide of Iron," If more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
one equivalent be present, small figures are placed below
the symbols: thus, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> represents two equivalents of
Iron united with three of Oxygen, or the "Peroxide of
Iron;" SO<sub>3</sub>, one equivalent of Sulphur with three of Oxygen,
or Sulphuric Acid.</p>

<p>Larger figures placed before and in the same line with
the symbols, affect the <i>whole compound</i> which the symbols
express: thus, 2 SO<sub>3</sub> means two equivalents of Sulphuric
Acid; 3 NO<sub>5</sub>, three equivalents of Nitric Acid. The interposition
of a comma prevents the influence of the large
figure from extending further. Thus, the double Hyposulphite
of Soda and Silver is represented as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
2 NaO S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, AgO S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,<br />
</p>

<p>or <i>two</i> equivalents of Hyposulphite of Soda with one of
Hyposulphite of Silver; the large figure referring only to
the first half of the formula. Sometimes brackets, etc. are
employed, in order to render a complicated formula more
plain. For example, the formula for the double Hyposulphite
of Gold and Soda, or "Sel d'or," may be written
thus;&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
3 (NaO S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) AuO S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 4 HO.<br />
</p>

<p>In this formula, the <i>plus sign</i> (+) denotes that the four
atoms of water which follow, are less intimately united
with the framework of the salt than the other constituents.</p>

<p>The use of a plus sign is commonly adopted in representing
salts which contain water of crystallization. Thus,
the formula for the crystallized Protosulphate of Iron is
written as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
FeO SO<sub>3</sub> + 7 HO.<br />
</p>

<p>These atoms of water are driven off by the application of
heat, leaving a white substance, which is the Anhydrous
salt, and would be written simply as FeO SO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The <i>plus</i> sign however is often employed in token of
simple <i>addition</i>, no combination of any kind being intended.
Thus the decomposition which follows on mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Chloride of Sodium with Nitrate of Silver may be written
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
NaCl + AgO NO<sub>5</sub> = AgCl + NaO NO<sub>5</sub>;<br />
</p>

<p>that is,&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption4nb">ON EQUIVALENT PROPORTIONS.</p>

<p>When elementary or compound bodies enter into chemical
union with each other, they do not combine in indefinite
proportions, as in the case of a mixture of two
liquids, or the solution of a saline body in water. On the
other hand, a certain definite weight of the one unites with
an equally definite weight of the other; and if an excess of
either be present, it remains free and uncombined.</p>

<p>Thus, if we take a <i>single grain</i> of the element Hydrogen&mdash;to
convert that grain into Water there will be required
exactly 8 grains of Oxygen; and if a larger quantity than
this were added, as for instance <i>ten grains</i>, then two grains
would be over and above. So, to form Hydrochloric Acid,
1 grain of Hydrogen takes 36 grains of Chlorine:&mdash;for
the <i>Hydriodic Acid</i>, 1 grain of Hydrogen unites with 126
grains of Iodine.</p>

<p>Again, if separate portions of metallic Silver, of 108
grains each, are weighed out,&mdash;in order to convert them
into Oxide, Chloride, and Iodide of Silver respectively,
there would be required</p>

<p>Therefore it appears that 8 grains of Oxygen are <i>equivalent</i>
to 36 grains of Chlorine and to 126 grains of Iodine,
seeing that these quantities all play the same part in combining;
and so it is with regard to the other elements,&mdash;to
every one of them a figure can be assigned which represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the number of parts by weight in which that element
unites with others. These figures are the "equivalents"
or "combining proportions," and they are denoted
by the <i>symbol</i> of the element. A symbol does not stand
as a simple representative of an element, but as a representative
of <i>one equivalent</i> of an element. Thus "O"
indicates 8 parts by weight of Oxygen; "Cl" one equivalent,
or 36 parts by weight, of Chlorine; and so with
the rest.</p>

<p>Observe however that these figures, termed "equivalents,"
do not refer to the <i>actual number</i> of parts by weight,
but only to the <i>ratio</i> which exists between them: if Oxygen
is 8, then Chlorine is 36; but if we term Oxygen 100, as
some have proposed, then Chlorine would be 442·65.</p>

<p>In the scale of equivalents now usually adopted, Hydrogen,
as being the lowest of all, is taken as unity, and the
others are related to it.</p>

<p><i>Equivalents of Compounds.</i>&mdash;The law of equivalent proportions
applies to compounds as well as to simple bodies,
the combining proportion of a compound being always the
sum of the equivalents of its constituents. Thus Sulphur
is 16, and Oxygen 8, therefore Sulphuric Acid, or SO<sub>3</sub>,
equals 40. The equivalent of Nitrogen is 14, that of Nitric
Acid, or NO<sub>5</sub>, is 54.</p>

<p>The same rule applies with regard to salts. Take for
instance the Nitrate of Silver: it contains</p>

</table>

<p><i>Practical application of the Laws of Combination .</i>&mdash;The
utility of being acquainted with the law of combining proportions
is obvious when their nature is understood. As
bodies both unite with and replace each other in equivalents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
a simple calculation shows at once how much of each
element or compound will be required in a given reaction.
Thus, supposing it be desired to convert 100 grains of Nitrate
of Silver into <i>Chloride</i> of Silver, the weight of Chloride
of Sodium which will be necessary is deduced thus:&mdash;one
equivalent, or 170 parts, of Nitrate of Silver, is decomposed
by an equivalent, or 60 parts, of Chloride of
Sodium. Therefore</p>

<p class="tdc">
as 170 : 60 :: 100 : 35·2;<br />
</p>

<p>that is, 35·2 grains of Salt will precipitate, in the state of
Chloride, the whole of the Silver contained in 100 grains
of Nitrate.</p>

<p>So again, in order to form the Iodide of Silver, the proportions
in which the two salts should be mixed is thus
shown. The equivalent of Iodide of Potassium is 166, and
that of Nitrate of Silver is 170. These numbers so nearly
correspond, that it is common to direct that equal weights
of the two salts should be taken.</p>

<p>One more illustration will suffice. Supposing it be required
to form 20 grains of Iodide of Silver&mdash;how much
Iodide of Potassium and Nitrate of Silver must be used?
One equivalent, or 166 parts, of Iodide of Potassium, will
yield an equivalent, or 234 parts, of Iodide of Silver;
therefore</p>

<p class="tdc">
as 234 : 166 :: 20 : 14·2.<br />
</p>

<p>Hence, if 14·2 grains of the Iodide of Potassium be dissolved
in water, and an equivalent quantity, viz. 14·5
grains, of the Nitrate of Silver added, the yellow precipitate,
when washed and dried, will weigh precisely 20
grains.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ON THE ATOMIC THEORY.</p>

<p>The atomic theory, originally proposed by Dalton, so
much facilitates the comprehension of chemical reactions
generally, that it may be useful to give a short sketch
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>It is supposed that all matter is made up of an infinite
number of minute atoms, which are elementary, and do
not admit of further division. Each of these atoms possesses
an actual weight, although inappreciable by our
present methods of investigation. Simple atoms, by uniting
with each other, form <i>compound atoms</i>; and when
these compounds are broken up, the elementary constituent
atoms are not destroyed, but separate from each
other, in possession of all their original properties.</p>

<p>In representing the simple atomic structure of bodies,
<i>circles</i> may be used, as in the following diagram.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/pg323.png" width="376" height="127" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 1.<span style="padding: 0 6em;">Fig. 2</span>Fig. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 1 is a compound atom of Sulphuric Acid, consisting
of an atom of Sulphur united intimately with three
of Oxygen; fig. 2 is an atom of Peroxide of Nitrogen,
NO<sub>4</sub>; and fig. 3, an atom of Nitric Acid, composed of
Nitrogen 1 atom. Oxygen 5 atoms, or in symbols NO<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p><i>The term "atomic weight" substituted for equivalent
proportion.</i>&mdash;If we suppose that the simple atoms of different
kinds of matter <i>differ in weight</i>, and that this
difference is expressed by their equivalent numbers, the
whole laws of combination follow by the simplest reasoning.
It is easy to understand that an atom of one element,
or compound, would displace, or be substituted for, a single
atom of another; therefore, taking as the illustration the
decomposition of Iodide of Potassium by Chlorine,&mdash;the
weight of the latter element required to liberate 126 grains
of Iodine is 36 grains, because <i>the weights of the atoms
of those two elementary bodies are as 36 to 126</i>. So again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
in the reaction between Chloride of Sodium and Nitrate
of Silver, a compound atom of the former, represented by
the weight 60, reacts upon a compound atom of the latter,
which equals 170.</p>

<p>Therefore in place of the term "equivalent" or "combining
proportion," it is more usual to employ that of
"atomic weight." Thus the atomic weight of Oxygen is
8, represented by the symbol O; that of Sulphur is 16;
hence the atomic weight of the compound atom of Sulphuric
Acid, or SO<sub>3</sub>, is necessarily equal to the combined
weights of the four simple atoms; <i>id est</i>, 16 + 24 = 40.</p>


<p class="caption4nb">ON THE CHEMISTRY OF ORGANIC SUBSTANCES.</p>

<p>By "organic" substances are meant those which have
possessed <i>life</i>, with definite organs and tissues, in
contra-distinction to the various forms of dead inorganic matter,
in which no structural organization of that kind is found.</p>

<p>The term organic however is also applied to substances
which are obtained by chemical processes from the vegetable
and animal kingdoms, although they cannot themselves
be said to be living bodies; thus Acetic Acid,
procured by the distillation of woody fibre, and Alcohol,
by fermentation from sugar, are strictly organic substances.</p>

<p>The class of organic bodies embraces a great variety of
products; which, like inorganic Oxides, may be divided
into neutral, acid, and basic.</p>

<p>The organic <i>acids</i> are numerous, including Acetic Acid,
Tartaric, Citric, and a variety of others.</p>

<p>The <i>neutral substances</i> cannot easily be assimilated to
any class of inorganic compounds; as examples, take
Starch, Sugar, Lignine, etc.</p>

<p>The <i>bases</i> are also a large class. They are mostly rare
substances, not familiarly known: Morphia, obtained from
Opium; Quinia, from Quinine; Nicotine, from Tobacco,
are illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Composition of organic and inorganic bodies contrasted.</i>&mdash;There
are more than fifty elementary substances found
in the inorganic kingdom, but only <i>four</i>, commonly speaking,
in the organic: these four are Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen,
and Oxygen.</p>

<p>Some organic bodies,&mdash;oil of turpentine, naphtha, etc.,
contain only Carbon and Hydrogen; many others, such as
sugar, gum, alcohol, fats, vegetable acids&mdash;Carbon, Hydrogen,
and Oxygen. The <i>Nitrogenous bodies</i>, so called, containing
Nitrogen in addition to the other elements, are
principally substances derived from animal and vegetable
tissues, such as Albumen, Caseine, Gelatine, etc.; Sulphur
and Phosphorus are also present in many of the Nitrogenous
bodies, but only to a small extent.</p>

<p>Organic substances, although simple as regards the
<i>number</i> of elements involved in their formation, are often
highly complex in the arrangement of the atoms; this may
be illustrated by the following formulæ:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Starch</td>
  <td class="tdl">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>20</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Lignine</td>
  <td class="tdl">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>20</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Cane Sugar</td>
  <td class="tdl">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>22</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Grape Sugar</td>
  <td class="tdl">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O<sub>28</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Inorganic bodies, as already shown, unite <i>in pairs</i>,&mdash;two
elements join to form a binary compound; two binary compounds
produce a salt; two salts associated together form
a double salt. With organic bodies however the arrangement
is different,&mdash;the elementary atoms are all grouped
equally in one compound atom, which is highly complex in
structure, and cannot be split up into binary products.</p>

<p>Observe also, as characteristic of Organic Chemistry,
the apparent similarity in composition between bodies
which differ widely in properties. As examples take <i>Lignine</i>,
or cotton fibre, and Starch,&mdash;each of which contains
the three elements united as C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>20</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Mode of distinguishing between Organic and Inorganic
matter.</i>&mdash;A simple means of doing this is as follows:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
place the suspected substance upon a piece of Platinum-foil,
and heat it to redness with a spirit-lamp: if it first
<i>blackens</i>, and then burns completely away, it is probably
of organic origin. This test depends upon the fact, that
the constituent elements of organic bodies are all either
themselves volatile, or capable of forming volatile combinations
with Oxygen. Inorganic substances, on the other
hand, are often unaffected by heat, or, if volatile, are dissipated
without previous charring.</p>

<p>The action of heat upon organic matter may further be
illustrated by the combustion of coal or wood in an ordinary
furnace;&mdash;first, an escape of Carbon and Hydrogen,
united in the form of volatile gaseous matter, takes place,
leaving behind a black cinder, which consists of Carbon
and inorganic matter combined; afterwards this Carbon
burns away into Carbonic Acid, and a grey ash is left
which is composed of inorganic salts, and is indestructible
by heat.</p>

Spirituous liquids, when perfectly pure, are not affected

Acetic Acid being volatile, distils over, and may be condensed.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Acetic Acid.</i>&mdash;The strongest acid contains
only a single atom of water; it is sold under the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of "Glacial Acetic Acid," so called from its property of
solidifying at a moderately low temperature. At about
50° the crystals melt, and form a limpid liquid of pungent
odour and a density nearly corresponding to that of
water; the specific gravity of Acetic Acid however is no
test of its real strength, which can only be estimated by
analysis.</p>

<p>The commercial <i>Glacial</i> Acetic Acid is often diluted
with water, which may be suspected if it does not solidify
during the cold winter months. Sulphurous and Hydrochloric
Acids are also common impurities. They are injurious
in Photographic Processes, from their property of
precipitating Nitrate of Silver. To detect them proceed
as follows:&mdash;dissolve a small crystal of Nitrate of Silver in
a few drops of water, and add to it about half a drachm of
the Glacial Acid; the mixture should remain quite clear
even when exposed to the light. Hydrochloric and Sulphurous
Acid produce a white deposit of Chloride or Sulphite
of Silver; and if <i>Aldehyde</i> or volatile tarry matter
be present in the Acetic Acid, the mixture with Nitrate
of Silver, although clear at first, becomes discoloured by
the action of light.</p>

<p>Glacial Acetic Acid sometimes has a smell of garlic. In
this state it probably contains an organic Sulphur Acid,
and is unfit for use.</p>

<p>Many employ a cheaper form of Acetic Acid, sold
by druggists as "Beaufoy's" acid; it should be of the
strength of the Acetic Acid fortiss. of the London Pharmacop&#339;ia,
containing 30 per cent, real acid. It will be
advisable to test it for Sulphuric Acid (see Sulphuric
Acid), and other impurities, before use.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">ALBUMEN.</p>

<p>Albumen is an organic principle found both in the
animal and vegetable kingdom. Its properties are best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
studied in the <i>white of egg</i>, which is a very pure form of
Albumen.</p>

<p>Albumen is capable of existing in two states; in one of
which it is soluble, in the other insoluble, in water. The
aqueous solution of the soluble variety gives a slightly
alkaline reaction to test-paper; it is somewhat thick and
glutinous, but becomes more fluid on the addition of a
small quantity of an alkali, such as Potash or Ammonia.</p>

<p>Soluble Albumen may be converted into the <i>insoluble</i>
form in the following ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>By the application of heat.</i>&mdash;A moderately strong
solution of Albumen becomes opalescent and coagulates
on being heated to about 150° Fahrenheit, but a temperature
of 212° is required if the liquid is very dilute. A
layer of <i>dried</i> Albumen cannot easily be coagulated by
the mere application of heat.</p>

<p>2. <i>By addition of strong acids.</i>&mdash;Nitric Acid coagulates
Albumen perfectly without the aid of heat. Acetic Acid
however acts differently, appearing to enter into combination
with the Albumen, and forming a compound soluble
in warm water acidified by Acetic Acid.</p>

<p>3. <i>By the action of metallic salts.</i>&mdash;Many of the salts
of the metals coagulate Albumen completely. Nitrate of
Silver does so; also the Bichloride of Mercury. Ammoniacal
Oxide of Silver however does not coagulate Albumen.</p>

<p>The white precipitate formed on mixing Albumen with
Nitrate of Silver is a chemical compound of the animal
matter with Protoxide of Silver. This substance, which
has been termed Albuminate of Silver, is soluble in Ammonia
and Hyposulphite of Soda; but after exposure to
light, or heating in a current of Hydrogen gas, it assumes
a brick-red colour, being probably reduced to the condition
of an organic compound of a <i>Suboxide</i> of Silver. It
is then almost insoluble in Ammonia, but enough dissolves
to tinge the liquid wine-red. The <i>red coloration</i> of solution
of Nitrate of Silver employed in sensitizing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Albuminized photographic paper is probably produced by
the same compound, although, often referred to the presence
of Sulphuret of Silver.</p>

<p>Albumen also combines with Lime and Baryta. When
Chloride of Barium is used with Albumen, a white precipitate
of this kind usually forms.</p>

<p><i>Chemical composition of Albumen.</i>&mdash;Albumen belongs to
the <i>Nitrogenous</i> class of organic substances (see <a href="#Page_325">page 325</a>).
It also contains small quantities of Sulphur and Phosphorus.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">ALCOHOL.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Atomic weight, 46.</p>

<p>Alcohol is obtained by the careful distillation of any
spirituous or fermented liquor. If wine or beer be placed
in a retort, and heat applied, the Alcohol, being more
volatile than water, rises first, and is condensed in an
appropriate receiver; a portion of the vapour of water
however passes over with the Alcohol, and dilutes it to a
certain extent, forming what is termed "Spirits of Wine."
Much of this water may be removed by redistillation from
Carbonate of Potash, in the manner described at page
196 of this work; but in order to render the Alcohol
thoroughly <i>anhydrous</i>, it is necessary to employ <i>Quicklime</i>,
which possesses a still greater attraction for water.
An equal weight of this powdered lime is mixed with
strong Alcohol of ·823, and the two are distilled together.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Alcohol.</i>&mdash;Pure anhydrous Alcohol is a
limpid liquid, of an agreeable odour and pungent taste;
sp. gr. at 60°, ·794. It absorbs vapour of water, and becomes
diluted by exposure to damp air; boils at 173° Fahr.
It has never been frozen.</p>

<p>Alcohol distilled from Carbonate of Potash has a specific
gravity of ·815 to ·823, and contains 90 to 93 per cent, of
real spirit.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of ordinary rectified Spirits of Wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
is usually about ·840, and it contains 80 to 83 per cent, of
absolute Alcohol.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">AMMONIA.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, NH<sub>3</sub> or NH<sub>4</sub>O. Atomic weight, 17.</p>

<p>The liquid known by this name is an aqueous solution
of the volatile gas Ammonia. Ammoniacal gas contains
one atom of Nitrogen combined with three of Hydrogen:
these two elementary bodies exhibit no affinity for each
other, but they can be made to unite under certain circumstances,
and the result is Ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Ammonia.</i>&mdash;Ammoniacal gas is soluble in
water to a large extent; the solution possessing those properties
which are termed alkaline (see <a href="#Page_308">page 308</a>). Ammonia
however differs from the other alkalies in one important
particular&mdash;it is volatile: hence the original colour
of turmeric-paper affected by Ammonia is restored on the
application of heat. Solution of Ammonia absorbs Carbonic
Acid rapidly from the air, and is converted into Carbonate
of Ammonia; it should therefore be preserved in
stoppered bottles. Besides Carbonate, commercial Ammonia
often contains Chloride of Ammonium, recognized
by the white precipitate given by Nitrate of Silver after
acidifying with pure Nitric Acid.</p>

<p>The strength of commercial Ammonia varies greatly;
that sold for pharmaceutical purposes under the name of
Liquor Ammoniæ, contains about 10 per cent, of real Ammonia.
The sp. gr. of aqueous Ammonia diminishes with
the proportion of Ammonia present, the Liquor Ammoniæ
being usually about ·936.</p>

<p>Ammonia, although forming a large class of salts, appears
at first sight to contrast strongly in composition with
the alkalies proper, such as Potash and Soda. Mineral
bases generally are <i>protoxides of metals</i>, as already shown
at <a href="#Page_308">page 308</a>, but Ammonia consists simply of Nitrogen
and Hydrogen united without Oxygen. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
remarks may perhaps tend somewhat to elucidate the difficulty:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Theory of Ammonium.</i>&mdash;This theory supposes the existence
of a substance possessing the properties of a <i>metal</i>,
but differing from metallic bodies generally in being <i>compound</i>
in structure: the formula assigned to it is NH<sub>4</sub>, one
atom of Nitrogen united with four of Hydrogen. This
hypothetical metal is termed "Ammonium;" and Ammonia,
associated with an atom of water, may be viewed as
its <i>Oxide</i>, for NH<sub>3</sub> + HO plainly equals NH<sub>4</sub>O. Thus,
as Potash is the Oxide of <i>Potassium</i>, so Ammonia is the
Oxide of <i>Ammonium</i>.</p>

<p>The composition of the <i>salts</i> of Ammonia is on this view
assimilated to those of the alkalies proper. Thus, Sulphate
of Ammonia is a Sulphate of the Oxide of Ammonium;
Muriate or Hydrochlorate of Ammonia is a Chloride
of Ammonium, etc.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, Br. Atomic weight, 78.</p>

<p>This elementary substance is obtained from the uncrystallizable
residuum of sea-water, termed <i>bittern</i>. It exists
in the water in very minute proportion, combined with
Magnesium in the form of a soluble Bromide of Magnesium.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Bromine is a deep reddish-brown liquid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
a disagreeable odour, and fuming strongly at common temperatures;
sparingly soluble in water (1 part in 23, Löwig),
but more abundantly so in Alcohol, and especially in Ether.
It is very heavy, having a specific gravity of 3·0.</p>

<p>Bromine is closely analogous to Chlorine and Iodine in
its chemical properties. It stands on the list intermediately
between the two; its affinities being stronger than
those of Iodine, but weaker than Chlorine (see Chlorine).</p>

<p>It forms a large class of salts, of which the Bromides of
Potassium, Cadmium, and Silver are the most familiar to
Photographers.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">BROMIDE OF POTASSIUM.</p>

<p>Bromide of Potassium is prepared by adding Bromine

of Bromide of Potassium and Bromate of Potash, to
redness, in order to drive off the Oxygen from the latter

<p>This salt was formerly obtained from the ashes of seaweeds,
but is now more economically manufactured on a
large scale from common salt. The Chloride of Sodium is
first converted into Sulphate of Soda, and afterwards the
Sulphate into Carbonate of Soda.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;The perfect crystals contain ten atoms of

Washing Soda</i> is a neutral Carbonate, contaminated to a
certain extent with Chloride of Sodium and Sulphate of
Soda. The Carbonate used for effervescing draughts is
either a Bicarbonate with 1 atom of water, or a Sesquicarbonate,
containing about 40 per cent, of real alkali; it is
therefore nearly double as strong as the washing Carbonate,
which contains about 22 per cent, of Soda. Carbonate
of Soda is soluble in twice its weight of water at 60°,
the solution being strongly alkaline.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">CHARCOAL, ANIMAL.</p>

<p>Animal Charcoal is obtained by heating animal substances,
such as bones, dried blood, horns, etc., to redness,
in close vessels, until all volatile empyreumatic matters
have been driven off, and a residue of Carbon remains.
When prepared from bones it contains a large quantity
of inorganic matter in the shape of Carbonate and Phosphate
of Lime, the former of which produces <i>alkalinity</i>
in reacting upon Nitrate of Silver (see <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>). Animal
Charcoal is freed from these earthy salts by repeated digestion
in Hydrochloric Acid; but unless very carefully
washed it is apt to retain an acid reaction, and so to liberate
free Nitric Acid when added to solution of Nitrate of
Silver.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Animal Charcoal, when pure, consists, solely
of Carbon, and burns away in the air without leaving any
residue: it is remarkable for its property of decolorizing
solutions; the organic colouring substance being separated,
but not actually <i>destroyed</i>, as it is by <i>Chlorine</i> employed
as a bleaching agent. This power of absorbing colouring
matter is not possessed in an equal degree by all varieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of Charcoal, but is in great measure peculiar to those
derived from the animal kingdom.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">CHINA CLAY, OR KAOLIN.</p>

<p>This is prepared, by careful levigation, from mouldering
granite and other disintegrated felspathic rocks. It consists
of the <i>Silicate of Alumina</i>,&mdash;that is, of Silicic Acid or
<i>Flint</i>, which is an Oxide of Silicon, united with the base
Alumina (Oxide of Aluminum). Kaolin is perfectly insoluble
in water and acids, and produces no decomposition
in solution of Nitrate of Silver. It is employed by Photographers
to decolorize solutions of Nitrate of Silver which
have become brown from the action of Albumen or other
organic matters.</p>

<p>Commercial Kaolin may contain chalk, in which state it
produces alkalinity in solution of Nitrate of Silver. The
impurity, detected by its effervescence with acids, is removed
by washing the Kaolin in diluted vinegar and subsequently
in water.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">CHLORINE.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, Cl. Atomic weight, 36.</p>

<p>Chlorine is a chemical element found abundantly in nature,
combined with metallic Sodium in the form of Chloride
of Sodium, or Sea-salt.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>&mdash;By distilling common Salt with Sulphuric
Acid, Sulphate of Soda and Hydrochloric Acid are formed.
Hydrochloric Acid contains Chlorine combined with Hydrogen;
by the action of nascent Oxygen (see Oxygen),
the Hydrogen may be removed in the form of water, and
the Chlorine left alone.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, of a pungent
and suffocating odour; soluble to a considerable
extent in water, the solution possessing the odour and
colour of the gas. It is nearly 2&frac12; times as heavy as a corresponding
bulk of atmospheric air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chemical properties.</i>&mdash;Chlorine belongs to a small natural
group of elements which contains also Bromine,
Iodine, and Fluorine. They are characterized by having
a strong affinity for Hydrogen, and also for the metals;
but are comparatively indifferent to Oxygen. Many metallic
substances actually undergo <i>combustion</i> when projected
into an atmosphere of Chlorine, the union between
the two taking place with extreme violence. The characteristic
bleaching properties of Chlorine gas are explained
in the same manner:&mdash;Hydrogen is removed from
the organic substance, and in that way the structure is
broken up and the colour destroyed.</p>

<p>Chlorine is more powerful in its affinities than either
Bromine or Iodine. The salts formed by these three elements
are closely analogous in composition and often in
properties. Those of the Alkalies, Alkaline Earths, and
many of the Metals, are soluble in water; but the Silver
salts are insoluble; the Lead salts sparingly so.</p>

<p>The combinations of Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, and
Fluorine, with Hydrogen, are acids, and neutralize Alkalies
in the usual, manner, with formation of Alkaline Chloride
and water (see <a href="#Page_311">page 311</a>).</p>

<p>The test by which the presence of Chlorine is detected,
either free or in combination with bases, is <i>Nitrate of
Silver</i>; it gives a white curdy precipitate of Chloride of
Silver, insoluble in Nitric Acid, but soluble in Ammonia.
The solution of Nitrate of Silver employed as the test
must not contain Iodide of Silver, as this compound is
precipitated by dilution.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">CHLORIDE OF AMMONIUM.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Atomic weight, 54.</p>

<p>This salt, also known as Muriate or Hydrochlorate of
Ammonia, occurs in commerce in the form of colourless
and translucent masses, which are procured by <i>sublimation</i>,
the dry salt being volatile when strongly heated. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
dissolves in an equal weight of boiling, or in three parts of
cold water. It contains more Chlorine in proportion to
the weight used than Chloride of Sodium, the atomic
weights of the two being as 54 to 60.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">CHLORIDE OF BARIUM.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, BaCl + 2 HO. Atomic weight, 123.</p>

<p>Barium is a metallic element very closely allied to Calcium,
the elementary basis of Lime. The Chloride of Barium
is commonly employed as a test for Sulphuric Acid,
with which it forms an insoluble precipitate of Sulphate
of Baryta. It is also said to affect the colour of the Photographic
image when used in preparing Positive paper,
which may possibly be due to a chemical combination of
Baryta with Albumen; but it must be remembered that
this Chloride, from its high atomic weight, contains less
Chlorine than the alkaline Chlorides (see <a href="#Page_124">page 124</a>).</p>

<p><i>Properties of Chloride of Barium.</i>&mdash;Chloride of Barium
occurs in the form of white crystals, soluble in about two
parts of water, at common temperature. These crystals
contain two atoms of water of crystallization, which are
expelled at 212°, leaving the anhydrous Chloride.</p>

<p>Properties of the pure Salt.&mdash;Fusible without decomposition
at low redness, but sublimes at higher temperatures;
the melted salt concretes into a hard white mass on cooling.
Nearly insoluble in absolute alcohol, but dissolves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
minute quantity in rectified spirit. Soluble in three parts
of water, both hot and cold. Crystallizes in cubes, which
are anhydrous.</p>

<p><i>Impurities of Common Salt.</i>&mdash;Table Salt often contains
large quantities of the Chlorides of Magnesium and Calcium,
which, being deliquescent, produce a dampness by
absorption of atmospheric moisture: Sulphate of Soda is
also commonly present. The salt may be purified by repeated
re-crystallization, but it is more simple to prepare
the pure compound <i>directly</i>, by neutralizing Hydrochloric
Acid with Carbonate of Soda.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><a id="CITRIC_ACID"></a>CITRIC ACID.</p>

<p>This acid is found abundantly in lemon-juice and in lime-juice.
It occurs in commerce in the form of large crystals,
which are soluble in less than their own weight of water
at 60°.</p>

<p>Commercial Citric Acid is sometimes mixed with Tartaric
Acid. The adulteration may be discovered by making
a concentrated solution of the acid and adding <i>Acetate of
Potash</i>; crystals of Bitartrate of Potash will separate if
Tartaric Acid be present.</p>

<p>Citric Acid is tribasic. It forms with Silver a white insoluble
salt, containing 3 atoms of Oxide of Silver to 1
atom of Citric Acid. When the Citrate of Silver is heated
in a current of Hydrogen gas, a part of the acid is liberated
and the salt is reduced to a Citrate of Suboxide of Silver;
which is of a red colour. The action of white light in reddening
Citrate of Silver is shown by the Author to be of a
similar nature.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Potassium. Cyanogen is not an elementary body, like
Chlorine or Iodine, but consists of Carbon and Nitrogen
united in a peculiar manner. Although a compound substance,
it reacts in the manner of an element, and is therefore
(like Ammonium, previously described) an exception
to the usual laws of chemistry. Many other bodies of a
similar character are known.</p>

<p>Properties of Cyanide of Potassium.&mdash;These have been
sufficiently described at <a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>, to which the reader is referred.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">ETHER.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O. Atomic weight, 37.</p>

<p>Ether is obtained by distilling a mixture of Sulphuric
Acid and Alcohol. If the formula of Alcohol (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
be compared with that of Ether, it will be seen to differ
from it in the possession of an additional atom of Hydrogen
and of Oxygen: in the reaction the Sulphuric Acid
removes these elements in the form of water, and by so
doing converts one atom of Alcohol into an atom of Ether.
The term Sulphuric applied to the commercial Ether has
reference only to the manner of its formation.</p>

<p>Properties of Ether.&mdash;The properties of Ether have been
described to some extent at pages 85 and 195. The following
particulars however may be added. It is neither
acid nor alkaline to test-paper. Specific gravity, at 60°,
about ·720. Boils at 98° Fahrenheit. The vapour is exceedingly
dense, and may be seen passing off from the
liquid and falling to the ground: hence the danger of pouring
Ether from one bottle to another if a flame be near at
hand.</p>

<p>Ether does not mix with water in all proportions; if the
two are shaken together, after a short time the former rises
and floats upon the surface. In this way a mixture of
Ether and Alcohol may be purified to some extent, as in the
common process of washing Ether. The water employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
however always retains a certain portion of Ether (about
a tenth part of its bulk), and acquires a strong ethereal
odour; washed Ether also contains water in small quantity.</p>

<p>Bromine and Iodine are both soluble in Ether, and gradually
react upon and decompose it.</p>

<p>The strong alkalies, such as Potash and Soda, also decompose
Ether slightly after a time, but not immediately.
Exposed to air and light. Ether is oxidized and acquires a
peculiar odour (<a href="#Page_85">page 85</a>).</p>

<p>Ether dissolves fatty and resinous substances readily,
but inorganic salts are mostly insoluble in this fluid.
Hence it is that Iodide of Potassium and other substances
dissolved in Alcohol are precipitated to a certain extent by
the addition of Ether.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">FLUORIDE OF POTASSIUM.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, KF. Atomic weight, 59.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>&mdash;Fluoride of Potassium is formed by saturating
Hydrofluoric Acid with Potash, and evaporating to
dryness in a platinum vessel. Hydrofluoric Acid contains
Fluorine combined with Hydrogen; it is a powerfully acid
and corrosive liquid, formed by decomposing Fluor Spar,
which is a Fluoride of Calcium, with strong Sulphuric
Acid; the action which takes place being precisely analogous
to that involved in the preparation of Hydrochloric
Acid.</p>

Albumen, but differing from it in properties. It is obtained
by subjecting bones, hoofs, horns, calves' feet, etc.,
to the action of boiling water. The jelly formed on cooling
is termed size, or, when dried and cut into slices, <i>glue</i>.
Gelatine, as it is sold in the shops, is a pure form of Glue.
<i>Isinglass</i> is gelatine prepared, chiefly in Russia, from the
air-bladders of certain species of sturgeon.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Gelatine.</i>&mdash;Gelatine softens and swells up
in cold water, but does not <i>dissolve</i> until heated: the hot
solution, on cooling, forms a tremulous jelly. One ounce
of cold water will retain about three grains of Isinglass
without gelatinizing; but much depends upon the temperature,
a few degrees greatly affecting the result.</p>

<p>When long boiled in water, and especially in presence
of an acid, such as the Sulphuric, Gelatine undergoes a
peculiar modification, and the Solution loses either partially
or entirely its property of solidifying to a jelly.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">GLYCERINE.</p>

<p>Fatty bodies are resolved by treatment with an alkali
into an Acid&mdash;which combines with the alkali, forming a
<i>soap</i>,&mdash;and Glycerine, remaining in solution.</p>

<p>Pure Glycerine, as obtained by Price's patent process of
distillation, is a viscid liquid of sp. gr. about 1·23; miscible
in all proportions with water and Alcohol. It is peculiarly
a neutral substance, exhibiting no tendency to combine
with acids or bases. It has little or no action upon Nitrate
of Silver in the dark, and reduces it very slowly even
when exposed to light.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">GLYCYRRHIZINE.</p>

<p>Glycyrrhizine, obtained from the fresh root of Liquorice,
is a substance intermediate in properties between a sugar
and a resin. Sparingly soluble in water but very soluble
in Alcohol. It precipitates strong solution of Nitrate of
Silver white, but the deposit becomes reddened by exposure
to light. Its preparation is described in the larger
works on organic chemistry.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">GOLD, CHLORIDE OF.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, AuCl<sub>3</sub>. Atomic weight, 303.</p>

<p>This salt is formed by dissolving pure metallic Gold in
Nitro-hydrochloric Acid, and evaporating at a gentle heat.
The solution affords deliquescent crystals of a deep orange
colour.</p>

<p>Chloride of Gold, in a state fit for Photographic use,
may easily be obtained by the following process:&mdash;Place
a half-sovereign in any convenient vessel, and pour on it
half a drachm of Nitric Acid mixed with two and a half
drachms of Hydrochloric Acid and three drachms of water;
digest by a gentle heat, but do not <i>boil</i> the acid, or much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of the Chlorine will be driven off in the form of gas. At
the expiration of a few hours add fresh Aqua-Regia in
quantity the same as at first, which will probably complete
the solution, but if not, repeat the process a third time.</p>

<p>Lastly, neutralize the liquid by adding Carbonate of
Soda until all effervescence ceases, and a green precipitate
forms; this is <i>Carbonate of Copper</i>, which must be allowed
several hours to separate thoroughly. The Chloride of
Gold is thus freed from Copper and Silver, with which the
metallic Gold is alloyed in the standard coin of the realm.
The solution so prepared will be <i>alkaline</i>, and consequently
prone to a reduction of metallic Gold: a slight extra
quantity of Hydrochloric acid should therefore be added,
sufficient to redden a piece of immersed litmus-paper.</p>

<p>The weight of a half-sovereign is about 61 grains, of
which 56 grains are pure Gold. This is equivalent to 86
grains of Chloride of Gold, which will be the quantity
contained in the solution.</p>

<p>The following process for preparing Chloride of Gold is
more perfect than the last:&mdash;Dissolve the Gold coin in
Aqua-Regia as before; then boil with excess of Hydrochloric
Acid, to destroy the Nitric Acid,&mdash;dilute largely
with distilled water, and add a filtered aqueous solution of
common Sulphate of Iron (6 parts to 1 of Gold); collect
the precipitated Gold, which is now free from copper;
redissolve in Aqua-Regia, and evaporate to dryness on a
water bath.</p>

<p>Avoid using <i>Ammonia</i> to neutralize Chloride of Gold, as
it would occasion a deposit of "Fulminating Gold," the
properties of which are described in the next page.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Chloride of Gold.</i>&mdash;As sold in commerce
it usually contains excess of Hydrochloric Acid, and is
then of a bright yellow colour; but when neutral and somewhat
concentrated, it is dark red (<i>Leo ruber</i> of the alchemists).
It gives no precipitate with Carbonate of Soda
unless heat be applied; the free Hydrochloric Acid present
forms, with the alkali. Chloride of Sodium, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
unites with the Chloride of Gold, and produces a double
salt, Chloride of Gold and Sodium, soluble in water.</p>

<p>Chloride of Gold is decomposed with precipitation of
metallic Gold by Charcoal, Sulphurous Acid, and many of
the vegetable acids; also by Protosulphate and Protonitrate
of Iron. It tinges the cuticle of an indelible purple
tint. It is soluble in Alcohol and in Ether.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">GOLD, FULMINATING.</p>

<p>This is a yellowish-brown substance, precipitated on
adding Ammonia to a strong solution of Chloride of Gold.</p>

<p>It may be dried carefully at 212°, but explodes violently
on being heated suddenly to about 290°. Friction also
causes it to explode when dry; but the moist powder may
be rubbed or handled without danger. It is decomposed
by Sulphuretted Hydrogen.</p>

<p>Fulminating Gold is probably an Aurate of Ammonia,
containing 2 atoms of Ammonia to 1 atom of Peroxide of
Gold.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, AuO S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Atomic weight, 253.</p>

<p>Hyposulphite of Gold is produced by the reaction of
Chloride of Gold upon Hyposulphite of Soda (see
<a href="#Page_133">page 133</a>).</p>

<p>The salt sold in commerce as Sel d'or is a double Hyposulphite
of Gold and Soda, containing one atom of the
former salt to three of the latter, with four atoms of water
of crystallization. It is formed by adding one part of
Chloride of Gold, in solution, to three parts of Hyposulphite
of Soda, and precipitating the resulting salt by Alcohol:
the Chloride of Gold must be added to the Hyposulphite
of Soda, and not the Soda salt to the Gold (see
<a href="#Page_250">page 250</a>).</p>

<p>Properties.&mdash;Hyposulphite of Gold is unstable and cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
exist in an isolated state, quickly passing into Sulphur,
Sulphuric Acid, and metallic Gold. When combined with
excess of Hyposulphite of Soda in the form of Sel d'or, it
is more permanent.</p>

<p>Sel d'or occurs crystallized in fine needles, which are
very soluble in water. The commercial article is often
impure, containing little else than Hyposulphite of Soda,
with a trace of Gold. It may be analyzed by adding a few
drops of strong Nitric Acid (free from Chlorine), diluting
with water, and afterwards collecting and igniting the yellow
powder, which is metallic Gold.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">GRAPE SUGAR.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O<sub>28</sub>. Atomic weight, 396.</p>

<p>This modification of Sugar, often termed <i>Granular Sugar</i>,
or <i>Glucose</i>, exists abundantly in the juice of grapes
and in many other varieties of fruit. It forms the saccharine
concretion found in honey, raisins, dried figs, etc. It
may be produced artificially by the action of fermenting
principles and of dilute mineral acids, upon Starch.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Grape Sugar crystallizes slowly and with
difficulty from a concentrated aqueous solution, in small
hemispherical nodules, which are hard, and feel gritty between
the teeth. It is much less sweet to the taste than
Cane Sugar, and not so soluble in water (1 part dissolves
in 1&frac12; of cold water).</p>

<p>Grape Sugar tends to absorb Oxygen, and hence it
possesses the property of decomposing the salts of the
noble metals, and reducing them by degrees to the metallic
state, even without the aid of light. <i>Cane</i> Sugar does
not possess these properties to an equal extent, and hence
it is readily distinguished from the other variety. The
product of the action of Grape Sugar upon Nitrate of
Silver appears to be a very low form of Oxide of Silver
combined with organic matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3nb">HONEY.</p>

<p>This substance contains two distinct kinds of Sugar,
Grape Sugar, and an uncrystallizable substance analogous
to, or identical with, the Treacle found associated with
common Sugar in the cane-juice. The agreeable taste of
Honey probably depends upon the latter, but its reducing
power on metallic oxides is due to the former. Pure Grape
Sugar can readily be obtained from inspissated Honey, by
treating it with Alcohol, which dissolves out the syrup,
but leaves the crystalline portion.</p>

<p>Much of the commercial article is adulterated, and, for
Photographic use, the Virgin Honey should be obtained
direct from the comb.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">HYDROCHLORIC ACID.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, HCl. Atomic weight, 37.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric Acid is a volatile gas, which may be liberated
from most of the salts termed Chlorides by the action
of Sulphuric Acid. The acid, by its superior affinities,
removes the base; thus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
NaCl + HO SO<sub>3</sub> = NaO SO<sub>3</sub> + HCl.<br />
</p>

<p>Properties.&mdash;Abundantly soluble in water, forming the
liquid Hydrochloric or Muriatic Acid of commerce. The
most concentrated solution of Hydrochloric Acid has a
sp. gr. 1·2, and contains about 40 per cent, of gas; that
commonly sold is somewhat weaker, sp. gr. 1·14 = 28 per
cent, real acid.</p>

<p>Pure Hydrochloric Acid is colourless, and fumes in the
air. The yellow colour of the commercial acid depends
upon the presence of traces of Perchloride of Iron, or of
organic matter; commercial Muriatic Acid also often
contains a portion of free Chlorine and of Sulphuric
Acid.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">HYDRIODIC ACID.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, HI. Atomic weight, 127.</p>

<p>This is a gaseous compound of Hydrogen and Iodine,
corresponding in composition to the Hydrochloric Acid.
It cannot however, from its instability, be obtained in the
same manner, since, on distilling an Iodide with Sulphuric
Acid, the Hydriodic Acid first formed is subsequently
decomposed into Iodine and Hydrogen. An aqueous solution
of Hydriodic Acid is easily prepared by adding
Iodine to water containing Sulphuretted Hydrogen gas;
a decomposition takes place, and Sulphur is set free: thus,
HS + I = HI + s.</p>

<p>Properties.&mdash;Hydriodic Acid is very soluble in water,
yielding a strongly acid liquid. The solution, colourless
at first, soon becomes brown from decomposition, and liberation
of free Iodine. It may be restored to its original
condition by adding solution of Sulphuretted Hydrogen.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><a id="HYDROSULPHURIC_ACID"></a>HYDROSULPHURIC ACID.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, HS. Atomic weight, 17.</p>

<p>This substance, also known as Sulphuretted Hydrogen,
is a gaseous compound of Sulphur and Hydrogen, analogous
in composition to the Hydrochloric and Hydriodic
Acid. It is usually prepared by the action of dilute Sulphuric
Acid upon Sulphuret of Iron, as described at page
373; the decomposition being similar to that involved in
the preparation of the Hydrogen acids generally:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
FeS + HO SO<sub>3</sub> = FeO SO<sub>3</sub> + HS.<br />
</p>

<p>Properties.&mdash;Cold water absorbs three times its bulk
of Hydrosulphuric Acid, and acquires the peculiar putrid
odour and poisonous qualities of the gas. The solution
is faintly acid to test-paper, and becomes opalescent on
keeping, from gradual separation of Sulphur. It is decomposed
by Nitric Acid, and also by Chlorine and Iodine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
It precipitates Silver from its solutions in the form of
black Sulphuret of Silver; also Copper, Mercury, Lead,
etc.; but Iron and other metals of that class are not affected,
if the liquid contains free acid. Hydrosulphuric
Acid is constantly employed in the chemical laboratory
for these and other purposes.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">HYDROSULPHATE OF AMMONIA.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, NH<sub>4</sub>S HS. Atomic weight, 51.</p>

<p>The liquid known by this name, and formed on passing
Sulphuretted Hydrogen gas into Ammonia, is a double
Sulphuret of Hydrogen and Ammonium. In the preparation,
the passage of the gas is to be continued until the
solution gives no precipitate with Sulphate of Magnesia,
and smells strongly of Hydrosulphuric Acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Colourless at first, but afterwards changes
to yellow, from liberation and subsequent solution of Sulphur.
Becomes milky on the addition of any acid. Precipitates,
in the form of Sulphuret, all the metals which
are affected by Sulphuretted Hydrogen, and, in addition,
those of the class to which Iron, Zinc, and Manganese
belong.</p>

<p>Hydrosulphate of Ammonia is employed in Photography
to darken the Negative image, and also in the preparation
of Iodide of Ammonium, the separation of Silver from
Hyposulphite solutions, etc.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">ICELAND MOSS.</p>

<p><i>Cetraria Islandica.</i>&mdash;A species of Lichen found in Iceland
and the mountainous parts of Europe; when boiled
in water, it first swells up, and then yields a substance
which gelatinizes on cooling.</p>

<p>It contains Lichen Starch, a bitter principle soluble in
Alcohol, termed "Cetrarine," and common Starch; traces
of Gallic Acid and Bitartrate of Potash are also present.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">IODINE.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, I. Atomic weight, 126.</p>

<p>Iodine is chiefly prepared at Glasgow, from <i>kelp</i>, which
is the fused ash obtained on burning seaweeds. The waters
of the ocean contain minute quantities of the Iodides
of Sodium and Magnesium, which are separated and stored
up by the growing tissues of the marine plant.</p>

<p>In the preparation, the mother-liquor of kelp is evaporated
to dryness and distilled with Sulphuric Acid; the
Hydriodic Acid first liberated is decomposed by the high
temperature, and fumes of Iodine condense in the form of
opaque crystals.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Iodine has a bluish-black colour and metallic
lustre; it stains the skin yellow, and has a pungent
smell, like diluted Chlorine. It is extremely volatile when
moist, boils at 350°, and produces dense violet-coloured
fumes, which condense in brilliant plates. Specific gravity
4·946. Iodine is very sparingly soluble in water, 1 part
requiring 7000 parts for perfect solution; even this minute
quantity however tinges the liquid of a brown colour. Alcohol
and Ether dissolve it more abundantly, forming
dark-brown solutions. Iodine also dissolves freely in solutions
of the alkaline Iodides, such as the Iodide of Potassium,
of Sodium, and of Ammonium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>&mdash;Iodine belongs to the Chlorine
group of elements, characterized by forming acids with
Hydrogen, and combining extensively with the metals (see
Chlorine). They are however comparatively indifferent
to Oxygen, and also to each other. The Iodides of the
alkalies and alkaline earths are soluble in water; also
those of Iron, Zinc, Cadmium, etc. The Iodides of Lead,
Silver, and Mercury are nearly or quite insoluble.</p>

<p>Iodine possesses the property of forming a compound
of a deep blue colour with Starch. In using this as a test,
it is necessary first to liberate the Iodine (if in combination)
by means of Chlorine, or Nitric Acids saturated with
Peroxide of Nitrogen. The presence of Alcohol or Ether
interferes to a certain extent with the result.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">IODIDE OF IRON.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, FeI. Atomic weight, 154.</p>

<p>Iodide of Iron is prepared by digesting an excess of
Iron filings with solution of Iodine in Alcohol. It is
very soluble in water and Alcohol, but the solution rapidly
absorbs Oxygen and deposits Peroxide of Iron; hence the
importance of preserving it in contact with metallic Iron,
with which the separated Iodine may recombine. By very
careful evaporation, hydrated crystals of Proto-iodide may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
be obtained, but the composition of the solid salt usually
sold under that name cannot be depended on.</p>

<p>The <i>Periodide</i> of Iron, corresponding to the <i>Perchloride</i>,
has not been examined, and it is doubtful if any
such compound exists.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">IODIDE OF POTASSIUM.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, KI. Atomic weight, 166.</p>

<p>This salt is usually formed by dissolving Iodine in solution
of Potash until it begins to acquire a brown colour;
a mixture of Iodide of Potassium and <i>Iodate of Potash</i>
(KO IO<sub>5</sub>) is thus formed; but by evaporation and heating
to redness, the latter salt parts with its Oxygen, and
is converted into Iodide of Potassium.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;It forms cubic and prismatic crystals,
which should be hard, and <i>very slightly or not at all deliquescent</i>.
Soluble in less than an equal weight of water
at 6O°; it is also soluble in Alcohol, but not in Ether. The
proportion of Iodide of Potassium contained in a saturated
alcoholic solution, varies with the strength of the spirit:&mdash;with
common Spirits of Wine, sp. gr. ·836, it would be
about 8 grains to the drachm; with Alcohol rectified from
Carbonate of Potash, sp. gr. ·823, 4 or 5 grains; with absolute
Alcohol, 1 to 2 grains. The solution of Iodide of
Potassium is instantly coloured brown by free Chlorine;
also very rapidly by Peroxide of Nitrogen (<a href="#Page_86">page 86</a>);
ordinary acids however act less quickly, Hydriodic Acid
being first formed, and subsequently decomposing spontaneously.</p>

the means to be adopted for their removal, are fully given
at <a href="#Page_197">page 197</a>.</p>

of Chloroform, Iodine being substituted for Chlorine. It
is obtained on boiling together Iodine, Carbonate of Potash,
and Alcohol.</p>

<p>Iodoform occurs in yellow nacrous crystals, which have
a saffron-like odour. It is insoluble in water, but soluble
in spirit.</p>

<p>The properties of this salt, and of the two salifiable
Oxides of Iron, are described at <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>. It dissolves in
rather more than an equal weight of cold water, or in less
of boiling water.</p>

<p>Aqueous solution of Sulphate of Iron absorbs the Binoxide
of Nitrogen, acquiring a deep olive-brown colour:
as this gaseous Binoxide is itself a reducing agent, the
liquid so formed has been proposed as a more energetic
developer than the Sulphate of Iron alone (?).</p>


<p class="caption3nb">IRON, PROTONITRATE OF.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, FeO NO<sub>3</sub> + 7 HO. Atomic weight, 153.</p>

<p>This salt, by careful evaporation <i>in vacuo</i> over Sulphuric
Acid, forms transparent crystals, of a light green
colour, and containing 7 atoms of water, like the Protosulphate.
It is exceedingly unstable, and soon becomes red
from decomposition, unless preserved from contact with
air. The preparation of solution of Protonitrate of Iron
for developing Collodion Positives, is given at <a href="#Page_206">page 206</a>.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">IRON, PERCHLORIDE OF.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>. Atomic weight, 164.</p>

<p>There are two Chlorides of Iron, corresponding in composition
to the Protoxide and the Sesquioxide respectively.
The Protochloride is very soluble in water, forming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
a green solution, which precipitates a dirty white Protoxide
on the addition of an alkali. The Perchloride, on the
other hand, is dark brown, and gives a foxy-red precipitate
with alkalies.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Perchloride of Iron may be obtained in
the solid form by heating Iron wire in excess of Chlorine;
it condenses in the shape of brilliant and iridescent brown
crystals, which are volatile, and dissolve in water, the solution
being acid to test-paper. It is also soluble in
Alcohol, forming the Tinctura Ferri Sesquichloridi of the
Pharmacop&#339;ia. Commercial Perchloride of Iron ordinarily
contains an excess of Hydrochloric Acid.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">LITMUS.</p>

<p>Litmus is a vegetable substance prepared from various

plaster of Paris, etc.</p>

<p>Litmus occurs in commerce in the form of small cubes
of a fine violet colour. In using it for the preparation of
test-papers, it is digested in hot water, and sheets of porous
paper are soaked in the blue liquid so formed. The

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;A very corrosive and poisonous salt, usually
sold in semi-transparent, crystalline masses, or in the
state of powder. Soluble in 16 parts of cold, and in 3

Ether. The solubility in water may be increased by the
addition of free Hydrochloric Acid, or of Chloride of Ammonium.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><a id="MILK"></a>MILK.</p>

<p>The Milk of herbivorous animals contains three principal

addition to these, small quantities of the Chloride of
Potassium, and of Phosphates of Lime and Magnesia, are
present.</p>

<p>The fatty matter is contained in small cells, and forms
the greater part of the cream which rises to the surface
of the milk on standing; hence shimmed milk is to be preferred
for Photographic use.</p>

<p>The second constituent, Caseine, is an organic principle
somewhat analogous to Albumen in composition and properties.
Its aqueous solution however does not, like Albumen,
<i>coagulate</i> on boiling, unless <i>an acid</i> be present,
which probably removes a small portion of alkali with
which the Caseine was previously combined. The substance
termed "rennet," which is the dried stomach of

brandy and other spirituous liquids, when free from acid
and astringent matter, have no effect.</p>

<p>In all these cases a portion of the Caseine usually remains
in a soluble form in the <i>whey</i>; but when the Milk
is coagulated by the addition of acids, the quantity so left
is very small, and hence the use of the rennet is to be preferred,
since the presence of Caseine facilitates the reduction
of the sensitive Silver salts.</p>

<p>Caseine combines with Oxide of Silver in the same manner
as Albumen, forming a white coagulum, which becomes
<i>brick-red</i> on exposure to light.</p>

<p>Sugar of Milk, the third principal constituent, differs
from both cane and grape sugar; it may be obtained by
evaporating <i>whey</i> until crystallization begins to take place.
It is hard and gritty, and only slightly sweet; slowly
soluble, without forming a syrup, in about two and a half
parts of boiling, and six of cold water. It does not ferment
and form Alcohol on the addition of yeast, like grape
sugar, but by the action of <i>decomposing animal matter</i> is
converted into Lactic Acid.</p>

<p>When skimmed Milk is exposed to the air for some
hours, it gradually becomes <i>sour</i>, from Lactic Acid formed
in this way; and if then heated to ebullition, the Caseine
coagulates very perfectly.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">NITRIC ACID.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, NO<sub>5</sub>. Atomic weight, 54.</p>

<p>Nitric Acid, or <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, is prepared by adding Sulphuric
Acid to Nitrate of Potash, and distilling the mixture
in a retort. Sulphate of Potash and free Nitric Acid
are formed, the latter of which, being volatile, distils over
in combination with one atom of water previously united
with the Sulphuric Acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Anhydrous Nitric Acid is a solid substance,
white and crystalline, but it cannot be prepared except by
an expensive and complicated process.</p>

<p>The concentrated <i>liquid</i> Nitric Acid contains 1 atom of
water, and has a sp. gr. of about 1·5; if perfectly pure, it
is colourless, but usually it has a slight yellow tint, from
partial decomposition into Peroxide of Nitrogen: it fumes
strongly in the air.</p>

<p>The strength of commercial Nitric Acid is subject to
much variation. An acid of sp. gr. 1·42, containing about
4 atoms of water, is commonly met with. If the specific
gravity is much lower than this (less than 1·36), it will
scarcely be adapted for the preparation of Pyroxyline.
The yellow <i>Nitrous Acid</i>, so called, is a strong Nitric Acid
partially saturated with the brown vapours of Peroxide of
Nitrogen; it has a high specific gravity, but this is somewhat
deceptive, being caused in part by the presence of the
Peroxide. On mixing with Sulphuric Acid, the colour disappears,
a compound being formed which has been termed
a <i>Sulphate of Nitrous Acid</i>.</p>

<p>In the Appendix a Table is given which exhibits the
quantity of real anhydrous Nitric Acid contained in samples
of different densities.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>&mdash;Nitric Acid is a powerful oxidizing
agent (see <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>); it dissolves all the common
metals, with the exception of Gold and Platinum. Animal
substances, such as the cuticle, nails, etc., are tinged of a
permanent yellow colour, and deeply corroded by a prolonged
application. Nitric Acid forms a numerous class
of salts, <i>all of which are soluble in water</i>. Hence its presence
cannot be determined by any precipitating reagent,
in the same manner as that of Hydrochloric and Sulphuric
Acid.</p>

<p><i>Impurities of Commercial Nitric Acid.</i>&mdash;These are
principally Chlorine and Sulphuric Acid; also Peroxide
of Nitrogen, which tinges the acid yellow, as already described.
Chlorine is detected by diluting the acid with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
equal bulk of distilled water, and adding a few drops of
Nitrate of Silver,&mdash;a <i>milkiness</i>, which, is Chloride of Silver
in suspension, indicates the presence of Chlorine. In testing
for Sulphuric Acid, dilute the Nitric Acid as before,
and drop in <i>a single drop</i> of solution of Chloride of Barium;
if Sulphuric Acid be present, an insoluble precipitate
of Sulphate of Baryta will be formed.</p>

<p>This salt, also termed <i>Nitre</i>, or <i>Saltpetre</i>, is an abundant
natural product, found effloresced upon the soil in certain
parts of the East Indies. It is also produced artificially
in what are called Nitre-beds.</p>

<p>Nitrate of Baryta forms octahedral crystals, which are
anhydrous. It is considerably less soluble than the Chloride
of Barium, requiring 12 parts of cold and 4 of boiling
water for solution. It may be substituted for the Nitrate
of Lead in the preparation of Protonitrate of Iron.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">NITRATE OF LEAD.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, PbO NO<sub>5</sub>. Atomic weight, 166.</p>

<p>Nitrate of Lead is obtained by dissolving the metal, or
the Oxide of Lead, in <i>excess</i> of Nitric Acid, diluted with
2 parts of water. It crystallizes on evaporation in white
anhydrous tetrahedra and octahedra, which are hard, and
decrepitate on being heated; they are soluble in 8 parts
of water at 60°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Nitrate of Lead forms with Sulphuric Acid, or soluble
Sulphates, a white precipitate, which is the insoluble Sulphate
of Lead. The <i>Iodide</i> of Lead is also very sparingly
soluble in water.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">NITRO-GLUCOSE.</p>

<p>When 3 fluid ounces of cold Nitro-Sulphuric Acid, consisting
of 2 ounces of Oil of Vitriol and 1 ounce of highly
concentrated Nitric Acid, are mixed with 1 ounce of finely
powdered Cane Sugar, there is formed at first a thin, transparent,
pasty mass. If it is stirred with a glass rod for a
few minutes without interruption, the paste coagulates as
it were, and separates from the liquid as a thick tenacious
mass, aggregating into lumps, which can easily be
removed from the acid mixture.</p>

<p>This substance has a very acid and intensely bitter
taste. Kneaded in warm water until the latter no longer
reddens litmus-paper, it acquires a silver colour and a
beautiful silky lustre. It may be used in Photography to
confer intensity upon newly mixed Collodion; but is inferior
to Glycyrrhizine employed for the same purpose.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><a id="NITRO-HYDROCHLORIC"></a>NITRO-HYDROCHLORIC ACID.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, NO<sub>4</sub> + Cl.</p>

<p>This liquid is the Aqua-Regia of the old alchemists. It
is produced by mixing Nitric and Hydrochloric Acids:
the Oxygen contained in the former combines with the
Hydrogen of the latter, forming water and liberating Chlorine,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tdc">
NO<sub>5</sub> + HCl = NO<sub>4</sub> + HO + Cl.<br />
</p>

<p>The presence of free Chlorine confers on the mixture the
power of dissolving Gold and Platinum, which neither of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the two acids possesses separately. In preparing Aqua-Regia
it is usual to mix one part, by measure, of Nitric
Acid with four of Hydrochloric Acid, and to dilute with
an equal bulk of water. The application of a gentle heat
assists the solution of the metal; but if the temperature
rises to the boiling point, a violent effervescence and escape
of Chlorine takes place.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">OXYGEN.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, O. Atomic weight, 8.</p>

<p>Oxygen gas may be obtained by heating Nitrate of Potash
to redness, but in this case it is contaminated with a
portion of Nitrogen. The salt termed Chlorate of Potash
(the composition of which is closely analogous to that of
the Nitrate, Chlorine being substituted for Nitrogen)
yields abundance of pure Oxygen gas on the application
of heat, leaving behind Chloride of Potassium.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>&mdash;Oxygen combines eagerly with
many of the chemical elements, forming Oxides. This
chemical affinity however is not well seen when the elementary
body is exposed to the action of <i>Oxygen in the
gaseous form</i>. It is the <i>nascent</i> Oxygen which acts most
powerfully as an oxidizer. By nascent Oxygen is meant
Oxygen on the point of separation from other elementary
atoms with which it was previously associated; it may
then be considered to be in the liquid form, and hence it
comes more perfectly into contact with the particles of the
body to be oxidized.</p>

<p>Illustrations of the superior chemical energy of nascent
Oxygen are numerous, but none perhaps are more striking
than the mild and gradual oxidizing influence exerted by
atmospheric air, as compared with the violent action of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>

<p class="caption3nb">POTASH.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, KO + HO. Atomic weight, 57.</p>

<p>Potash is obtained by separating the Carbonic Acid
from Carbonate of Potash by means of Caustic Lime.
Lime is a more feeble base than Potash, but the Carbonate
of Lime, being <i>insoluble</i> in water, is at once formed
on adding Milk of Lime to a solution of Carbonate of
Potash (see <a href="#Page_314">page 314</a>).</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Usually met with in the form of solid
lumps, or in cylindrical sticks, which are formed by melting
the Potash and running it into a mould. It always
contains one atom of water, which cannot be driven off by
the application of heat.</p>

<p>Potash is soluble almost to any extent in water, much
heat being evolved. The solution is powerfully alkaline
(<a href="#Page_308">p. 308</a>), and acts rapidly upon the skin; it dissolves
fatty and resinous bodies, converting them into soaps.
Solution of Potash absorbs Carbonic Acid quickly from
the air, and should therefore be preserved in stoppered
bottles; the glass stoppers must be wiped occasionally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
in order to prevent them from becoming immovably fixed
by the solvent action of the Potash upon the Silica of the
glass.</p>

<p>The Liquor Potassæ of the London Pharmacop&#339;ia has
a sp. gr. of 1·063, and contains about 5 per cent, of real
Potash. It is usually contaminated with <i>Carbonate</i> of Potash,
which causes it to effervesce on the addition of acids;
also, to a less extent, with Sulphate of Potash, Chloride
of Potassium, Silica, etc.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">POTASH, CARBONATE OF.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, KO CO<sub>2</sub>. Atomic weight, 70.</p>

<p>The impure Carbonate of Potash, termed <i>Pearlash</i>, is
obtained from the ashes of wood and vegetable matter, in
the same manner as Carbonate of Soda is prepared from
the ashes of seaweeds. Salts of Potash and of Soda appear
essential to vegetation, and are absorbed and approximated
by the living tissues of the plant. They exist in
the vegetable structure, combined with organic acids in the
form of salts, like the Oxalate, Tartrate, etc., which, when
burned are converted into Carbonates.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;The Pearlash of commerce contains large
and variable quantities of Chloride of Potassium, Sulphate
of Potash, etc. A purer Carbonate is sold, which is free
from Sulphates, and with only a trace of Chlorides. Carbonate
of Potash is a strongly alkaline salt, deliquescent,
and soluble in twice its weight of cold water; insoluble in
Alcohol, and employed to deprive it of water (see <a href="#Page_196">page 196</a>).</p>

<p>This metal, the <i>Luna</i> or <i>Diana</i> of the alchemists, is
found native in Peru and Mexico; it occurs also in the
form of Sulphuret of Silver.</p>

<p>When pure it has a sp. gr. of 10·5, and is very malleable
and ductile; melts at a bright red heat. Silver does not
oxidize in the air, but when exposed to an impure atmosphere
containing traces of Sulphuretted Hydrogen, it is
slowly tarnished from formation of Sulphuret of Silver.
It dissolves in Sulphuric Acid, but the best solvent is
Nitric Acid.</p>

<p>The standard coin of the realm is an alloy of Silver and
Copper, containing about one-eleventh of the latter metal.</p>

<p>To prepare pure Nitrate of Silver from it, dissolve in
Nitric Acid and evaporate until crystals are obtained. Then
wash the crystals with a little dilute Nitric Acid, redissolve
them in water, and crystallize by evaporation a second
time. Lastly, fuse the product at a moderate heat, in order
to expel the last traces of Nitric and Nitrous Acids.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><a id="SILVER_AMMONIO"></a>SILVER, AMMONIO-NITRATE OF.</p>

<p>Crystallized Nitrate of Silver absorbs Ammoniacal gas
rapidly, with production of heat sufficient to fuse the resulting
compound, which is white, and consists of 100 parts
of the Nitrate + 29·5 of Ammonia. The compound however
which Photographers employ under the name of
Ammonio-Nitrate of Silver may be viewed more simply
as a solution of the Oxide of Silver in Ammonia, without
reference to the Nitrate of Ammonia necessarily produced
in the reaction.</p>

<p>Very strong Ammonia, in acting upon Oxide of Silver,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
converts it into a black powder, termed <i>Fulminating Silver</i>,
which possesses the most dangerous explosive properties.
Its composition is uncertain. In preparing Ammonio-Nitrate
of Silver by the common process, the Oxide first
precipitated occasionally leaves a little black powder behind,
on re-solution; this does not appear however, according
to the observations of the Author, to be Fulminating
Silver.</p>

<p>Nitrite of Silver is a compound of Nitrous Acid, or NO<sub>3</sub>,
with Oxide of Silver. It is formed by heating Nitrate of
Silver, so as to drive off a portion of its Oxygen, or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
conveniently, by mixing Nitrate of Silver and Nitrite of
Potash in equal parts, fusing strongly, and dissolving in a
small quantity of boiling water: on cooling, the Nitrite
crystallizes out, and may be purified by pressing in blotting-paper.
Mr. Hadow describes an economical method of
preparing Nitrite of Silver in quantity, viz. by heating 1
part of Starch in 8 of Nitric Acid of 1·25 specific gravity,
and conducting the evolved gases into a solution of pure
Carbonate of Soda until effervescence has ceased. The
Nitrite of Soda thus formed is afterwards added to Nitrate
of Silver in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Nitrite of Silver is soluble in 120 parts of
cold water; easily soluble in boiling water, and crystallizes,
on cooling, in long slender needles. It has a certain degree
of affinity for Oxygen, and tends to pass into the condition
of Nitrate of Silver; but it is probable that its Photographic
properties depend more upon a decomposition of the
salt and liberation of Nitrous Acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties of Nitrous Acid.</i>&mdash;This substance possesses
very feeble acid properties, its salts being decomposed
even by Acetic Acid. It is an unstable body, and splits
up, in contact with water, into Binoxide of Nitrogen and
Nitric Acid. The Peroxide of Nitrogen, NO<sub>4</sub>, is also decomposed
by water, and yields the same products.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, SO<sub>3</sub>. Atomic weight, 40.</p>

<p>Sulphuric Acid may be formed by oxidizing Sulphur
with boiling Nitric Acid; but this plan would be too expensive
to be adopted on a large scale. The commercial
process for the manufacture of Sulphuric Acid is exceedingly
ingenious and beautiful, but it involves reactions
which are too complicated to admit of a superficial explanation.
The Sulphur is first burnt into gaseous Sulphurous
Acid (SO<sub>2</sub>), and then by the agency of Binoxide of
Nitrogen gas, an additional atom of Oxygen is imparted
from the atmosphere, so as to convert the SO<sub>2</sub> into SO<sub>3</sub>,
or Sulphuric Acid.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Anhydrous Sulphuric Acid is a white crystalline
solid. The strongest liquid acid always contains
one atom of water, which is closely associated with it, and
cannot be driven off by the application of heat.</p>

<p>This <i>mono-hydrated</i> Sulphuric Acid, represented by the
formula HO SO<sub>3</sub>, is a dense fluid, having a specific gravity
of about 1·845; boils at 620°, and distils without decomposition.
It is not volatile at common temperatures, and
therefore does not <i>fume</i> in the same manner as Nitric or
Hydrochloric Acid. The concentrated acid maybe cooled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
down even to zero without solidifying; but a weaker compound,
containing twice the quantity of water, and termed
<i>glacial</i> Sulphuric Acid, crystallizes at 40° Fahr. Sulphuric
Acid is intensely acid and caustic, but it does not destroy
the skin or dissolve metals so readily as Nitric Acid. It
has an energetic attraction for water, and when the two
are mixed, condensation ensues, and much heat is evolved;
four parts of acid and one of water produce a temperature
equal to that of boiling water. Mixed with aqueous Nitric
Acid, it forms the compound know a as Nitro-Sulphuric
Acid.</p>

<p>Sulphuric Acid possesses intense chemical powers, and
displaces the greater number of ordinary acids from their
salts. It <i>chars</i> organic substances, by removing the elements
of water, and converts Alcohol into Ether in a
similar manner. The <i>strength</i> of a given sample of Sulphuric
Acid may be calculated, nearly, from its specific
gravity, and a Table is given by Dr. Ure for that purpose.
(See Appendix.)</p>

<p><i>Impurities of Commercial Sulphuric Acid.</i>&mdash;The liquid
acid sold as Oil of Vitriol is tolerably constant in composition,
and seems to be as well adapted for Photographic
use as the <i>pure</i> Sulphuric Acid, which is far more expensive.
The specific gravity should be about 1·836 at
60°. If a drop, evaporated upon Platinum-foil, gives a
fixed residue, probably Bisulphate of Potash is present. A
milkiness, on dilution, indicates Sulphate of Lead (see
<a href="#Page_186">page 186</a>).</p>

<p><i>Test for Sulphuric Acid.</i>&mdash;If the presence of Sulphuric
Acid, or a soluble Sulphate, be suspected in any liquid, it
is tested for by adding a few drops of dilute solution of
Chloride of Barium, or Nitrate of Baryta. A white precipitate,
<i>insoluble in Nitric Acid</i>, indicates Sulphuric Acid.
If the liquid to be tested is very acid, from Nitric or
Hydrochloric Acid, it must be largely diluted before testing,
or a crystalline precipitate will form, caused by the
sparing solubility of the Chloride of Barium itself in acid
solutions.</p>

<p>This is a gaseous compound, formed by burning Sulphur
in atmospheric air or Oxygen gas: also by heating Oil of
Vitriol in contact with metallic Copper, or with Charcoal.</p>

<p>When an acid of any kind is added to Hyposulphite of
Soda, Sulphurous Acid is formed as a product of the decomposition
of Hyposulphurous Acid, but it afterwards
disappears from the liquid by a secondary reaction, resulting
in the production of Trithionate and Tetrathionate of
Soda.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Sulphurous Acid possesses a peculiar and
suffocating odour, familiar to all in the fumes of burning
Sulphur. It is a feeble acid, and escapes with effervescence,
like Carbonic Acid, when its salts are treated with Oil of
Vitriol. It is soluble in water.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">WATER.</p>

<p class="tdc">Symbol, HO. Atomic weight, 9.</p>

<p>Water is an Oxide of Hydrogen, containing single atoms
of each of the gases.</p>

<p><i>Distilled water</i> is water which has been vaporized and
again condensed; by this means it is freed from earthy
and saline impurities, which, not being volatile, are left in
the body of the retort. <i>Pure</i> distilled water leaves no residue
on evaporation, and should remain perfectly clear on
the addition of Nitrate of Silver, <i>even when exposed to the
light</i>; it should also be neutral to test-paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The condensed water of steam-boilers sold as distilled
water is apt to be contaminated with oily and empyreumatic
matter, which discolours Nitrate of Silver, and is therefore
injurious.</p>

<p><i>Rain-water</i>, having undergone a natural process of distillation,
is free from inorganic salts, but it usually contains
a minute portion of <i>Ammonia</i>, which gives it an alkaline
reaction to test-paper. It is very good for Photographic
purposes if collected in clean vessels, but when taken from
a common rain-water tank should always be examined,
and if much organic matter be present, tingeing it of a
brown colour and imparting an unpleasant smell, it must
be rejected.</p>

<p><i>Spring</i> or <i>River</i> water, commonly known as "hard
water," usually contains Sulphate of Lime, and Carbonate
of Lime dissolved in Carbonic Acid; also Chloride of Sodium
in greater or less quantity. On boiling the water,
the Carbonic Acid gas is evolved, and the greater part of
the Carbonate of Lime (if any is present) deposits, forming
an earthy incrustation on the boiler.</p>

<p>In testing water for Sulphates and Chlorides, acidify a
portion with a few drops of <i>pure</i> Nitric Acid, free from
Chlorine (if this is not at hand, use pure Acetic Acid);
then divide it into two parts, and add to the first a <i>dilute</i>
solution of Chloride of Barium, and to the second, Nitrate
of Silver,&mdash;a milkiness indicates the presence of Sulphates
in the first case or of Chlorides in the second. The <i>Photographic
Nitrate Bath</i> cannot be used as a test, since the
Iodide of Silver it contains is precipitated on dilution,
giving a milkiness which might be mistaken for Chloride
of Silver.</p>

<p>Common hard water can often be used for making a Nitrate
Bath when nothing better is at hand. The Chlorides
it contains are precipitated by the Nitrate of Silver, leaving
soluble <i>Nitrates</i> in solution, which are not injurious.
The Carbonate of Lime, if any is present, neutralizes free
Nitric Acid, rendering the Bath alkaline in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
manner as Carbonate of Soda. (See <a href="#Page_89">page 89</a>.) Sulphate of
Lime, usually present in well water, is said to exercise a
retarding action upon the sensitive Silver Salts, but on
this point the writer is unable to give certain information.</p>

<p>Hard water is not often sufficiently pure for the developing
fluids. The Chloride of Sodium it contains decomposes
the Nitrate of Silver upon the film, and the image cannot
be brought out perfectly. The <i>New River water</i>, however,
supplied to many parts of London, is almost free from
Chlorides, and answers very well. In other cases a few
drops of Nitrate of Silver solution may be added, to separate
the Chlorine, taking care not to use a large excess.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</a></h2>


<p class="caption3nb">QUANTITATIVE TESTING OF SOLUTIONS OF NITRATE OF SILVER.</p>

<p>The amount of Nitrate of Silver contained in solutions of that salt
may be estimated with sufficient delicacy for ordinary Photographic
operations by the following simple process.</p>

<p>Take the <i>pure</i> crystallized Chloride of Sodium, and either dry it
strongly or fuse it at a moderate heat, in order to drive off any water
which may be retained between the interstices of the crystals; then
dissolve in distilled water, in the proportion of 8&frac12; grains to 6 fluid
ounces.</p>

<p>In this way, a standard solution of salt is formed, each drachm of
which (containing slightly more than one-sixth of a grain of salt) will
precipitate exactly half a grain of Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p>In order to use it, measure out accurately one drachm of the Bath in
a minim measure and place it in a two-ounce stoppered phial, taking
care to rinse out the measure with a drachm of distilled water, which
is to be added to the former; then pour in the salt solution, in the
proportion of a drachm for every 4 grains of Nitrate <i>known to be
present</i> in an ounce of the Bath which is to be tested; shake the contents
of the bottle briskly, until the white curds have perfectly separated,
and the supernatant liquid is clear and colourless; then add
fresh portions of the standard solution, by 30 minims at a time, with
constant shaking. When the last addition causes no <i>milkiness</i>, read
off the total number of drachms employed (the last half-drachm being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
subtracted), and multiply that number by 4 for the weight in grains
of the Nitrate of Silver present in an ounce of the Bath.</p>

<p>In this manner the strength of the Bath is indicated within two
grains to the ounce, or even to a single grain if the last additions
of standard salt-solution be made in portions of 15, instead of 30
minims.</p>

<p>Supposing the Bath to be tested is thought to contain about 35
grains of Nitrate to the ounce, it will be convenient to begin by adding
to the measured drachm, 7 <i>drachms</i> of the standard solution;
afterwards, as the milkiness and precipitation become less marked,
the process must be carried on more cautiously, and the bottle shaken
violently for several minutes, in order to obtain a clear solution. A
few drops of Nitric Acid added to the Nitrate of Silver facilitate the
deposition of the Chloride; but care must be taken that the sample
of Nitric Acid employed is pure and free from Chlorine, the presence
of which would cause an error.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">RECOVERY OF SILVER FROM WASTE SOLUTIONS,&mdash;FROM
THE BLACK DEPOSIT OF HYPO-BATHS, ETC.</p>

<p>The manner of separating metallic Silver from waste solutions varies
according to the presence or absence of alkaline Hyposulphites and
Cyanides.</p>

<p>a. <i>Separation of metallic Silver from old Nitrate Baths.</i>&mdash;The
Silver contained in solutions of the Nitrate, Acetate, etc. may easily
be precipitated by suspending a strip of sheet Copper in the liquid;
the action is completed in two or three days, the whole of the Nitric
Acid and Oxygen passing to the Copper, and forming a blue solution
of the Nitrate of Copper. The metallic Silver however, separated in
this manner, always contains a portion of Copper, and gives a blue
solution when dissolved in Nitric Acid.</p>

<p>A better process is to commence by precipitating the Silver entirely
in the form of <i>Chloride of Silver</i>, by adding common Salt
until no further milkiness can be produced. If the liquid is well
stirred, the Chloride of Silver sinks to the bottom, and may be
washed by repeatedly filling the vessel with common water, and pouring
off the upper clear portion when the clots have again settled down.
The Chloride of Silver thus formed may afterwards be reduced to metallic
Silver by a process which will presently be described (<a href="#Page_374">p. 374</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>b. <i>Separation of Silver from solutions containing alkaline Hyposulphites,
Cyanides, or Iodides.</i>&mdash;In this case the Silver cannot be
precipitated by adding Chloride of Sodium, since the Chloride of Silver
is soluble in such liquids. It is necessary therefore to use the
Sulphuretted Hydrogen, or the Hydrosulphate of Ammonia, and to
separate the Silver in the form of Sulphuret.</p>

<p>Sulphuretted Hydrogen gas is readily prepared, by fitting a cork
and flexible tubing to the neck of a pint bottle, and having introduced
Sulphuret of Iron (sold by operative chemists for the purpose), about
as much as will stand in the palm of the hand, pouring upon it 1&frac12;
fluid ounce of Oil of Vitriol diluted with 10 ounces of water. The
gas is generated gradually without the application of heat, and must
be allowed to bubble up through the liquid from which the Silver is
to be separated. The smell of Sulphuretted Hydrogen being offensive,
and highly poisonous if inhaled in a concentrated form, the
operation must be carried on in the open air, or in a place where the
fumes may escape without doing injury.</p>

<p>When the liquid begins to acquire a strong and persistent odour of
Sulphuretted Hydrogen, the precipitation of Sulphuret is completed.
The black mass must then be collected upon a filter, and washed by
pouring water over it, until the liquid which runs through gives little
or no precipitate with a drop of Nitrate of Silver.</p>

<p>The Silver may also be separated in the form of Sulphuret from old
Hypo-Baths, by adding Oil of Vitriol in quantity sufficient to decompose
the Hyposulphite of Soda; and burning off the free Sulphur
from the brown deposit.</p>

<p>Conversion of Sulphuret of Silver into metallic Silver.&mdash;The black
Sulphuret of Silver may be reduced to the state of metal by roasting
and subsequent fusion with Carbonate of Soda; but it is more convenient,
in operating on a small scale, to proceed in the following
manner:&mdash;first convert the Sulphuret into Nitrate of Silver, by boiling
with Nitric Acid diluted with two parts of water; when all evolution
of red fumes has ceased, the liquid may be diluted, allowed to
cool, and filtered from the insoluble portion, which consists principally
of Sulphur, but also contains a mixture of Chloride and Sulphuret
of Silver, unless the Nitric Acid employed was free from Chlorine;
this precipitate may be heated, in order to volatilize the Sulphur,
and then digested with Hyposulphite of Soda, or added to the
Hypo-Bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The solution of Nitrate of Silver obtained by dissolving Sulphuret
of Silver, is always strongly acid with Nitric Acid, and also contains
<i>Sulphate</i> of Silver. It may be crystallized by evaporation; but unless
the quantity of material operated on is large, it will be better to
precipitate the Silver in the form of Chloride, by adding common
Salt, as already recommended.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">REDUCTION OF CHLORIDE OF SILVER TO THE METALLIC STATE.</p>

<p>The Chloride of Silver is first to be carefully washed, by filling up
the vessel which contains it, many times with water, and pouring off
the liquid, or drawing it off close with a siphon. It may then be
dried at a gentle heat, and fused with twice its weight of dry Carbonate
of Potash, or better still, with a mixture of the Carbonates of
Potash and Soda.</p>

<p>The process for reducing Chloride of Silver in the moist way,
by metallic Zinc and Sulphuric Acid, is more economical and less
troublesome than that just given; it is conducted as follows:&mdash;The
Chloride, after having been well washed as before, is placed in a
large flat dish, and a bar of metallic Zinc laid in contact with it.
A small quantity of Oil of Vitriol, diluted with four parts of water, is
then added, until a slight effervescence of Hydrogen gas is seen to
take place. The vessel is set aside for two or three days, and is not
to be disturbed, either by stirring or by moving the bar. The reduction
begins with the Chloride immediately in contact with the Zinc,
and radiates in all directions. When the whole mass has become of
a grey colour, the bar is to be carefully removed and the adhering
Silver washed off with a stream of water; the Zinc usually presents
a honeycombed appearance, with irregularities upon the surface, which
however are not metallic Silver;&mdash;they consist only of Zinc or of
Oxide of Zinc.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the purity of the Silver, a fresh addition of Sulphuric
Acid must be made, after the Zinc bar has been removed, and
the digestion continued for several hours, in order to dissolve any
fragments of metallic Zinc which may have been inadvertently detached.
The grey powder must be repeatedly washed, first with Sulphuric
Acid and water (this is necessary to dissolve a portion of an insoluble
Salt of Zinc, probably an oxychloride) and then with water
alone, until the liquid runs away <i>neutral</i>, and gives no precipitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
with Carbonate of Soda; it may then be fused into a button, to burn
off organic matter if present, and subsequently converted into Nitrate
of Silver by boiling with Nitric Acid diluted with two parts of water.</p>

<p>In reducing Chloride of Silver precipitated from old Nitrate Baths
<i>containing Iodide of Silver</i>, the grey metallic powder is sometimes
contaminated with unreduced Iodide of Silver, which dissolves in the
solution of Nitrate of Silver formed on treating the mass with Nitric
Acid. To avoid this, wash the purified Silver with solution of Hyposulphite
of Soda, and then again with water.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">MODE OF TAKING THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF LIQUIDS.</p>

<p>Instruments are sold, termed "Hydrometers," which indicate specific
gravity by the extent to which a glass bulb containing air, and
properly balanced, rises or sinks, in the liquid; but a more exact
process, and one equally simple, is by the use of the specific gravity
bottle.</p>

<p>These bottles are made to contain exactly 1000 grains of distilled
water, and with each is sold <i>a brass weight</i>, which counterbalances
it when filled with pure water.</p>

<p>In taking the specific gravity of a liquid, fill the bottle quite full
and insert the stopper, which being pierced through by a fine capillary
tube allows the excess to escape. Then, having wiped the bottle
quite dry, place it in the scale-pan, and ascertain the number of grains
required to produce equilibrium; this number added to, or subtracted
from, <i>unity</i> (the assumed specific gravity of water), will give the density
of the liquid.</p>

<p>Thus, to take examples, supposing the bottle filled with <i>rectified
Ether</i> to require 250 grains to enable it to counterbalance the brass
weight,&mdash;then 1· <i>minus</i> ·250, or ·750, is the specific gravity; but in
the case of <i>Oil of Vitriol</i> the bottle, when full, will be heavier than
the counterpoise by perhaps 836 grains; therefore 1· <i>plus</i> ·836, <i>id
est</i> 1·836, is the density of the sample examined.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bottle is made to hold only 500 grains of distilled
water, in place of 1000; in this case the number of grains to be added
or subtracted must be multiplied by 2.</p>

<p>In taking specific gravities, observe that the temperature be within
a few degrees of 60° Fahrenheit (if higher or lower, immerse the
bottle in warm or cold water); and wash out the bottle thoroughly
with water each time after use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3nb">ON FILTRATION AND WASHING PRECIPITATES.</p>

<p>In preparing filters, cut the paper into squares of a sufficient size,
and fold each square neatly upon itself, first into a half-square, and
then again, at right angles, into a quarter-square;&mdash;round off the
corners with a pair of scissors, and open out the filter into a conical
form, when it will be found to drop exactly into the funnel, and to be
uniformly supported throughout.</p>

<p>Before pouring in the liquid, always moisten the filter with distilled
water, in order to expand the fibres; if this precaution be
neglected, the pores are apt to become choked in filtering liquids
which contain finely divided matter in suspension. The solution to
be filtered may be poured gently down a glass rod, held in the left
hand (<i>a silver spoon</i> may be used, in case of necessity, for Nitrate
Baths, and all liquids not containing Nitric or Hydrochloric Acid),
and directed against the side of the funnel, near to the upper part.
If it does not immediately run clear, it will usually do so on returning
it into the filter and allowing it to pass through a second time.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Washing Precipitates.</i>&mdash;Collect the precipitate upon a
filter and drain off as much of the mother-liquor as possible; then
pour in distilled water by small portions at a time, allowing each to
percolate through the deposit before adding a fresh quantity. When
the water passes through perfectly pure, the washing is complete;
in testing it, a single drop may be laid upon a strip of glass and allowed
to evaporate spontaneously in a warm place, or the proper
chemical reagents may be applied, and the washing continued until
no impurity can be detected. Thus, for example, in washing the
Sulphuret of Silver precipitated from a Hypo-Bath by means of
Hydrosulphate of Ammonia, the process will be completed when the
water which runs through causes no deposit with a drop of Nitrate
of Silver solution.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">ON THE USE OF TEST-PAPERS.</p>

<p>The nature of the colouring matter which is employed in the
preparation of litmus-paper has already been described at <a href="#Page_353">page 353</a>.</p>

<p>In testing for the alkalies and basic oxides generally, the blue
litmus-paper which has been reddened by an acid may be used, or, in
place of it, the <i>turmeric</i>-paper. Turmeric is a yellow vegetable substance
which possesses the property of becoming brown when treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
with an alkali; it is however less sensitive than the reddened litmus,
and is scarcely affected by the weaker bases, such as Oxide of Silver.</p>

<p>In using test-papers, observe the following precautions:&mdash;they
should be kept in a dark place, and protected from the action of the
air, or they soon become purple from Carbonic Acid, always present
in the atmosphere in small quantity. By immersion in water containing
about one drop of Liquor Potassæ or Ammoniæ, or a grain
of Carbonate of Soda to four ounces, the blue colour is restored. As
the quantities which are tested for in Photography are often infinitesimally
small, it is essential that the litmus-paper should be in good
condition; and test-papers prepared with porous paper will be found
to show the colour better than those upon glazed or strongly-sized
paper. The mode of employing the paper is as follows:&mdash;Place a
small strip in the liquid to be examined: if it becomes at once <i>bright
red</i>, a strong acid is present; but if it changes <i>slowly to a wine-red</i>
tint, a weak acid, such as Acetic or Carbonic, is indicated. In the
case of the Photographic Nitrate Bath faintly acidified with Acetic
Acid, a purple colour only may be expected, and a decided red colour
would suggest the presence of Nitric Acid. In the Hypo fixing and
toning Bath which has acquired acidity, the litmus-paper will perhaps
redden in about three or four minutes.</p>

<p>Blue litmus-papers may be changed to the red papers used for
alkalies by soaking in water acidified with Sulphuric Acid, one drop
to half a pint; or by holding for an instant near the mouth of a
bottle containing Glacial Acetic Acid. In examining a Nitrate Bath
for alkalinity by means of the reddened litmus-paper, at least five or
ten minutes should be allowed for the action, since the change of
colour from red to blue takes place very slowly.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">REMOVAL OF SILVER STAINS FROM THE HANDS, LINEN, ETC.</p>

<p>The black stains upon the hands caused by Nitrate of Silver, may
readily be removed by moistening them and rubbing with a lump of
Cyanide of Potassium. As this salt however is highly poisonous,
many may prefer the following plan:&mdash;Wet the spot with a saturated
solution of Iodide of Potassium, and afterwards with Nitric Acid (the
strong Nitric Acid acts upon the skin and turns it yellow, it must
therefore be diluted with two parts of water before use); then wash
with solution of Hyposulphite of Soda.</p>

<p>Stains upon white linen may be easily removed by brushing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
with a solution of Iodine in Iodide of Potassium, and afterwards
washing with water and soaking in Hyposulphite of Soda, or Cyanide
of Potassium, until the yellow Iodide of Silver is dissolved out; the
Bichloride of Mercury (neutral solution) also answers well in many
cases, changing the dark spot to white (<a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>).</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
